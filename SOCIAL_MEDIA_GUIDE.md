# RateMyBaliBuilder - Instagram & TikTok Guide

## The Goal

Build a following of expats and investors interested in Bali property. Convert followers → website visitors → paying members.

**Not vanity metrics.** We don't need 100K followers. We need 5,000 engaged people who might build in Bali.

---

## Platform Strategy

| Platform | Audience | Content Style | Posting Frequency |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Instagram** | 30-50yr expats, investors, lifestyle seekers | Polished, informative, aspirational | 4-5x/week |
| **TikTok** | 25-40yr, more casual, discovery-driven | Raw, entertaining, hook-driven | 5-7x/week |

**Start with Instagram.** Our audience skews older and higher income. TikTok is bonus reach.

## Content Formats That Work

### Instagram

| Format | Best For | Tips |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Carousel** | Horror stories, tips, before/after | First slide = hook, last slide = CTA |

| **Stories** | BTS, polls, quick updates | Use polls/questions for engagement |
| **Static post** | Quotes, milestones, announcements | Use sparingly, algorithm favors video |

### TikTok

| Format | Best For | Tips |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Storytime** | Horror stories, scam reveals | "So this guy paid $300K for a villa..." |
| **POV** | Day in the life, site visits | "POV: You're verifying a Bali builder" |
| **Duet/Stitch** | React to bad advice, other creators | Find Bali content to respond to |
| **Tutorial** | Quick tips, explainers | "How to check if your builder is legit" |

## Hook Templates (First 2 Seconds)

The hook determines if people watch. Steal these:

### Fear/Curiosity
- "This contractor scammed 14 expats..."
- "Never pay a builder like this..."
- "The villa looked perfect until..."
- "I can't believe this is legal in Bali..."
- "This is why your build is over budget..."

### Direct Value
- "How to vet a Bali builder in 5 minutes"
- "3 things your contract is missing"
- "This one clause saved me $40K"
- "Ask this question before signing anything"

### Pattern Interrupt
- "Stop. Don't hire that builder yet."
- "Your agent won't tell you this..."
- "I was today years old when I learned..."
- "Wait—did your builder just say this?"

### Controversy
- "Unpopular opinion: cheap builders aren't the problem"
- "Everyone's doing Bali wrong"
- "The real reason builds go over budget"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Posting without a hook** - First 2 seconds decide everything
2. **Too polished** - Raw/authentic outperforms on TikTok
3. **No CTA** - Always tell them what to do next
4. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm rewards consistency
5. **Ignoring comments** - Engagement drives reach
6. **Only promotional content** - 80% value, 20% promotion
7. **Copying competitors exactly** - Adapt, don't clone
8. **Giving up after 30 days** - Takes 3-6 months to build momentum

---

## Quick Reference: Content Formula

```
HOOK (2 sec) → STORY/VALUE (15-45 sec) → CTA (3 sec)
```

### Example Reel Script:

**Hook:** "This contractor scammed 14 expats in Canggu."

**Story:** "He'd collect 50% upfront, start the foundation, then disappear. By the time anyone realized, he'd moved to the next project. We found 14 people with the same story."

**CTA:** "We've built a database so this doesn't happen to you. Link in bio to check your builder."
