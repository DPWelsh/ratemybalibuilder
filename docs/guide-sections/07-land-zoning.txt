For example, the CA of an apartment
building that we were asked to design
on the cliffs in Uluwatu is the following:
From these results, we understand that
CA is small family groups that won’t
buy large luxury properties but
something middle range with a friendly
payment schedule. As they live in big
cities, they are not used to being
surrounded by nature but rather
appreciate an enclosed space with the
comfort of air conditioning. 
They value the good quality,
convenience, and simplicity of the
interior. Simple kitchen for infrequent
cooking, big bedroom with walking
closet, and a bathroom with double
sinks.

Don’t get confused if you market your
property to the determined CA but
sometimes you get bookings from
people that are not related to it. Your
CA is not all your potential customers
but the biggest percentage of them.
These are the people you want to go for
because they are more likely to buy
your product. 
You should also keep an eye on
consumer trends. We have noticed that,
since the pandemic, people are
traveling in smaller groups and,
therefore, the rental market for larger
villas is not doing as well as the smaller
boutique villa market.

It’s also important to protect your
investment by getting insurance right
after the construction is done or even
during the construction if it’s a larger
development. We recommend using a
European insurance company such as
Allianz to provide your property the
best protection. 
Our insurance plan protects our villas
from natural disasters such as floodings,
volcano eruptions, tsunami, lightning
strikes, and earthquakes which can be
common for Bali. The insurance also
covers robberies, fires, damages from
rental guests, and many others. We
recommend contacting them to get a
full list of damage protection and
review the contract carefully before
signing. 
First, we calculate the costs that the
villa will have every month. Our costs
are a little bit lower than normal
because our one-bedroom villa is
located next door to our other four
villas and we split the cost for the
gardener, cleaning, pool maintenance,
and security between all five villas. You
can also make an agreement with the
owners of the neighboring villas to
share such services and, thus, have
lower monthly costs for it.
CALCULATING
ROI 
Before you start building the project,
you have to understand what Return
On Investment (ROI) you can expect.
Here is an example of how we calculate
ROI for a one-bedroom villa that we are
planning to rent (see p. 30).

DETERMINE DAILY RATE
To set up a correct rate for your rental
property, go to Airbnb and see at what
rate your competitors list their
properties. Is your villa newer and in a
better location? Slightly increase the
rate. We have used an occupancy rate
of 80-90% as this is what we were
experiencing before the pandemic. 
In our calculations, we considered low
and high rates to see a whole picture in
both scenarios (rates for low and high
seasons, however, in 2017-2019 there
were no true low seasons). Normally,
the average between the low and high
rates is what you will get in reality. We
advise that you change your rental rates
based on what you are experiencing in
terms of occupancy rate.  
We made these calculations for our villa
buyers, so we included a 15% marketing
fee in case they decide to use this
service to market their property. We
promote the villas through our
Instagram page to make them more
desirable, organize paid photoshoots
for local brands and bloggers, and
manage all the bookings through
Airbnb and Instagram. You can make
your investment a hands-off passive
income stream if you use our marketing
service, together with the villa
management company. If you prefer to
do your own marketing, you will get a
higher ROI if you can get the same
occupancy rate.

DETERMINE
OCCUPANCY RATE
Based on our villa's performance before
the pandemic, we determined an
occupancy rate of 90%. Also, look at
your competitors, determine their
average occupancy rate and use it for
your calculations. Once you determine
all the numbers from above, it’s time to
calculate your Low and High Monthly
Revenue. 
To do it, just multiply 30.4 average days
per month (365 / 12) by the Low
Estimate (or High) and multiply by 90%
for the occupancy rate. The calculation
will look like this: 30.4 days x $170/night
x 90% = $4651 or 30.4 days x $221 x 90%
= $6047. 
Numbers that you will get are showing
you the range of monthly revenue that
you will get if you price your property at
the lowest price and the highest price.
You can calculate an average as well to
understand what revenue, in reality,
can be expected.
