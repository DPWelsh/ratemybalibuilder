## Contract with Your Builder

A well-structured contract protects your investment and sets clear expectations. This chapter covers what to include, how to structure payments, and how to protect yourself throughout the construction process.

## What to Clarify Before Signing

### Scope of Work

Before signing any contract, clarify exactly what is included:

**Basic Construction:**
- Foundation and structural work
- Walls, floors, and roofing
- Basic electrical and plumbing
- Standard finishes

**Items Often NOT Included:**
- Custom kitchen build-out
- Built-in closets and wardrobes
- Custom furniture
- Wall niches and sunken lounges
- Premium fixtures and fittings
- Landscaping
- Pool equipment

**Get specific answers:** If your design includes custom elements like wall niches or sunken lounges, confirm whether they're included in the quoted price or will cost extra.

### Material Specifications

Specify the quality of materials in your contract:

**Fixtures:**
- Bathroom fixtures (brand and model)
- Kitchen fixtures
- Door and window hardware

**Finishes:**
- Tile quality and source
- Paint quality and brand
- Flooring materials

**Structural:**
- Concrete mix specifications
- Rebar grade and sizing
- Waterproofing materials

**Pro Tip:** Consider shopping for tiles, bathroom fixtures, and kitchen fittings yourself. This ensures you get exactly the quality you want and can sometimes save money.

## Critical Contract Elements

### Foundation Requirements

Foundations are crucial in Bali due to soil conditions and earthquake risk:

**Require in your contract:**
- Geological survey completion before foundation design
- Foundation depth based on survey results
- Deep cement column foundations
- Large rebar-reinforced cement footings
- Foundation design appropriate for building height

### Roofing and Waterproofing

Bali's heavy rainfall makes roofing critical:

**For cement roofs, require:**
- Double waterproofing technique:
  1. First layer: Cement waterproofing material
  2. Second layer: Bitumen sheets sealed with heat gun

**Warning:** Most builders only apply the first layer. Insist on double waterproofing—it's worth the extra cost.

**Also specify:**
- Rain gutter installation
- Proper drainage from roof
- Quality roofing materials
- Wall waterproofing from mid-height to floor
- Membrane between walls and floor

## Payment Structure

### Recommended Payment Schedule

Structure payments based on construction milestones:

| Milestone | Payment |
|-----------|---------|
| Contract signing | 25-30% |
| Foundation complete | 15-20% |
| Walls and roof complete | 15-20% |
| Interior work complete | 15-20% |
| Final completion | 10-15% |
| After punch list | 5-10% |

### Key Payment Principles

1. **Don't overpay upfront** - Limit initial payment to 25-30%
2. **Tie payments to milestones** - Pay when work is verified complete
3. **Hold back final payment** - Reserve 10-20% until 100% complete
4. **Verify before paying** - Inspect work before releasing funds

### Retention for Completion

Include a clause that:
- Final 10-20% is not paid until the project is 100% complete
- A punch list is created and all items are addressed
- You have reasonable time to inspect completed work

## Timeline and Penalties

### Realistic Timeline

Work with your builder to establish:
- Clear start date
- Milestone dates for each phase
- Realistic completion date
- Buffer time for weather or unexpected issues

### Completion Penalty Clause

Include a penalty statement:
- If not completed on time, builder forfeits 5-10% of build cost
- This amount is deducted from final payment
- Clearly define what "completion" means

This gives the builder incentive to meet deadlines and protects you from endless delays.

### Delay Provisions

Also address:
- What happens if you cause delays (design changes, payment delays)
- How weather delays are handled
- Process for extending timeline if needed

## Warranty Requirements

### One-Year Warranty

Require a written warranty that includes:
- Return to fix superficial wall cracks (normal in first year as building settles)
- Repair of any construction defects
- Replacement of faulty materials
- Response time for warranty claims

### What the Warranty Should Cover

**Structural:**
- Foundation issues
- Wall cracks beyond cosmetic
- Roof leaks

**Systems:**
- Plumbing problems
- Electrical issues
- Drainage failures

**Finishes:**
- Paint peeling due to poor application
- Tile cracking due to improper installation
- Door and window operation issues

### Document Everything

- Get warranty terms in writing
- Photograph the property at completion
- Keep records of any issues reported
- Document all warranty work performed

## Additional Contract Provisions

### Change Order Process

Define how changes are handled:
- Written change orders required for any modifications
- Pricing for changes agreed before work begins
- Impact on timeline documented
- Both parties must sign off on changes

### Dispute Resolution

Include provisions for:
- How disputes will be resolved
