MARKETING
Website. Create a one-page
website and put all the necessary
information about your villa. We
suggest including: 
A short description with the
price (fully or unfurnished) and
location.
Naming your villa. Come up with a
name that is easy to remember,
reflects your villa style, and is easy to
pronounce. We don’t recommend
using the Indonesian name as it's
not easy to remember and
sometimes very hard to read. People
might not be able to find you on
Google or social media if your
project name is in Indonesian and it
makes it harder to market your
brand internationally. 
NON-PAID MARKETING
TECHNIQUES

attract potential buyers. There are
several paid and free marketing

Property details with the number of rooms, land and building size, style,
UVP, leasehold (remaining years and terms) or freehold, and more.
Remember that you’re selling the property to people who would like to
invest. Thus, adding rental yield information is an essential step that will
make your villa more desirable to the buyer.
It’s important to add a payment schedule so it’s easier for the buyer to
understand whether this investment is affordable or not. This also gives the
buyer some base from where he or she can start the negotiation from. We,
normally, provide some flexibility with the payment schedule and opened to
negotiation.
