SELLING YOUR PROJECT

The first thing you have to consider
is how much you spent to build the
villa including your land cost.
Calculate your total costs and write
this number down. 
Then, do the research and see at
what price similar villas to yours are
being sold. Put at least ten numbers
in the Excel spreadsheet and
calculate the average. To do that,
use the formula “=AVERAGE”. Write
the result next to your total cost
number.
Calculate your potential income by
subtracting the total cost number
from the average price number. You
will get the amount that you will
earn after selling your villa at the
average price. Are you happy with it?
There are several steps you should take
to price your villa fairly:

If you think you should charge more for
your villa than the average price, then
you are going to enter a tough market
of premium-priced villas. To determine
how much more you can charge for
your villa, think of what is your unique
value proposition (UVP). UVP is
something that differentiates you from
your competitors. What unique features
does your villa have? It can be anything. 
Starting from location (ocean view or a
heart of the popular area) and design
(unique marble facing of the walls) to
swimming pool with seawater. In many
ways, we charge a premium price
because of our branding, marketing,
design, and construction experience.
You will need to communicate this to
the buyer as well. 
Once you determine your UVP, think
how much people will value it. Is it
worth paying more? If yes, how much
more? Add this amount to the average
price. The result you will get is your
premium price for your villa.
