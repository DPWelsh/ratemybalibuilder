## PBG Building Permit

The PBG (Persetujuan Bangunan Gedung) is Indonesia's building permit system that replaced the previous IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan). Understanding this permit process is essential for legal construction in Bali.

## What is PBG?

PBG stands for "Persetujuan Bangunan Gedung" which translates to "Building Construction Authorization." It is a mandatory permit for anyone who wants to:

- Build a new building
- Renovate or change an existing building
- Maintain a building in certain ways

Unlike the previous IMB system, PBG functions more as a licensing rule that regulates how buildings should be built rather than a pre-construction permit.

## Why PBG Matters

Building without proper permits can result in:

- Construction being halted
- Fines and legal penalties
- Forced demolition
- Inability to sell or rent legally
- Problems with insurance claims
- Issues with utility connections

**Never skip this step**, regardless of what anyone tells you about "informal arrangements."

## What PBG Regulates

The PBG specifications outline:

- **Roof design** requirements
- **Number of floors** permitted
- **Building coverage** percentage
- **Building style** requirements
- **Setback distances** from property lines
- **Maximum height** restrictions

For example, a five-story apartment building with a flat roof on a small residential plot would likely be rejected under PBG requirements.

## The Application Process

### Step 1: Prepare Technical Documents

Before applying, prepare:
- Architectural design drawings
- Site plan
- Owner/applicant information
- Land certificate and ownership documents

### Step 2: Submit to Local Government

Submit your technical plan documents to your district, city, or provincial government office before construction begins.

### Step 3: Document Review

After initial submission and approval, you'll need to submit:
- Detailed information on the applicant/owner
- Complete building data
- Full technical plan documents

### Step 4: SIMBG Registration

Registration is completed through the SIMBG (Building Management Information System), an online portal. The applicant or owner registers through this system.

### Step 5: Consultation Process

After registration is confirmed complete, the Secretariat schedules planning consultations including:
- Inspection of compliance with technical standards
- Review of design elements
- Verification of documentation

### Step 6: Final Examination

The final review includes a conclusion recommending either:
- Issuance of a Compliance Statement with Technical Standards, OR
- Re-registration of PBG with required modifications

## Timeline Expectations

While the government states PBG can be issued within 2 days, realistically you should plan for a longer timeline:

- **Optimistic:** 2-4 weeks
- **Realistic:** 1-3 months
- **Complex projects:** 3-6 months

**Recommendation:** Apply for PBG as soon as your architectural design is finalized. Don't wait until you're ready to break ground.

## Additional Required Documents

Beyond PBG, you may need:

### SBKBG (Proof of Building Ownership)
Required documentation proving building ownership after construction.

### SLF (Building Feasibility Certificate)
Must be renewed:
- Every **5 years** for non-residential buildings
- Every **20 years** for residential buildings

## Tips for Successful PBG Approval

### Work with Professionals

Before designing your project, consult with:
- An experienced architect familiar with local regulations
- A builder who understands PBG requirements
- Local consultants who know the approval process

This upfront investment saves time and prevents redesign costs later.

### Understand Local Variations

PBG requirements:
- Vary between different areas of Bali
- Change periodically
- Have different interpretations by different offices

Stay updated on current regulations for your specific area.

### Design for Compliance

Work with your architect to ensure your design:
- Meets all zoning requirements
- Respects height limitations
- Falls within building coverage ratios
- Includes required setbacks
- Uses permitted building styles

### Allow Time in Your Schedule

Build PBG approval time into your project timeline:
- Don't sign construction contracts with unrealistic start dates
- Plan for potential revision requests
- Have contingency time in your schedule

## Common PBG Issues

### Design Non-Compliance
- Building too tall for the zone
- Exceeding coverage ratios
- Incorrect roof style for the area

### Documentation Problems
- Incomplete applications
- Missing owner information
- Incorrect land documentation

### Zoning Conflicts
- Land zoned for agriculture
- Green zone restrictions
- Tourism vs. residential classification

## What to Do If PBG Is Denied

If your initial application is rejected:

1. **Understand the reasons** - Get clear explanation of non-compliance
2. **Modify your design** - Work with your architect to address issues
3. **Resubmit** - Follow the proper re-application process
4. **Consider alternatives** - Some projects may not be viable on certain land

**Never proceed without proper approval**, regardless of pressure from builders or sellers.

## Working with Consultants

Consider hiring a PBG consultant or an experienced builder who offers this service:

- They understand current requirements
- They have relationships with local offices
- They can anticipate potential issues
- They save you time and frustration

The cost is typically worthwhile for the stress reduction and faster approval.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PBG is mandatory** - Don't build without it
2. **Apply early** - Start the process as soon as design is complete
3. **Work with professionals** - Architects and consultants who know the system
4. **Design for compliance** - It's easier than trying to get exceptions
5. **Allow adequate time** - Don't rush this process
6. **Stay updated** - Regulations change frequently
7. **Get it right** - The consequences of non-compliance are severe

Proper PBG approval is a fundamental requirement for any legal construction project in Bali. Treat it as a non-negotiable step in your investment process.
