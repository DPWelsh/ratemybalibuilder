## Villa Management

Once your villa is complete, ongoing management determines whether it becomes a profitable investment or a stressful liability. This chapter covers your options for managing a rental villa in Bali.

## The Importance of Good Management

Proper villa management handles:

- **Guest relations** - Check-ins, communication, issue resolution
- **Staff oversight** - Cleaning, maintenance, security
- **Property maintenance** - Repairs, upkeep, prevention
- **Financial management** - Expenses, payments, reporting
- **Booking coordination** - Calendars, platforms, guest screening
- **Concierge services** - Airport transfers, activities, special requests

Without proper management, your rental income suffers and your property deteriorates.

## Management Options

### Option 1: Professional Villa Management Company

The most common approach for investors:

**What They Handle:**
- All guest check-ins and check-outs
- Hiring, training, and managing staff
- Paying staff salaries
- Electricity and utility payments
- Maintenance coordination
- Concierge services (transfers, activities, chefs)
- Regular property inspections

**Pricing Models:**

*Flat Fee per Bedroom:*
- Fixed monthly rate per bedroom
- Expenses charged separately
- More predictable costs
- You keep more upside from higher occupancy

*Percentage of Revenue:*
- Typically 25-30% of all bookings
- All expenses come from this percentage
- Less upside for you
- Higher revenue means higher management cost

**Recommendation:** Flat-fee arrangements typically work better for investors, as you keep more profit when bookings are strong.

### Option 2: Self-Management

Managing the property yourself:

**What You Handle:**
- Responding to guest inquiries
- Managing booking platforms (Airbnb, etc.)
- Coordinating with staff directly
- Handling maintenance issues
- Managing finances and expenses
- Guest communication

**Pros:**
- No management fees
- Direct control over guest experience
- All revenue stays with you

**Cons:**
- Significant time commitment
- Requires local presence or reliable contacts
- Must handle all problems personally
- Can be stressful, especially remotely

**Best For:**
- Investors living in Bali
- Those with flexible schedules
- Smaller portfolio of properties

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Combine self-management with select services:

- Use a management company for staffing only
- Handle your own Airbnb listings and bookings
- Hire individual contractors for maintenance
- Use concierge services on-demand

This reduces costs while maintaining quality.

## Choosing a Management Company

### What to Look For

**Reputation:**
- References from current clients
- Online reviews of managed properties
- Years in business
- Portfolio of properties managed

**Services Offered:**
- Comprehensive vs. limited services
- 24/7 availability for guests
- Multilingual staff
- Quality of concierge offerings

**Reporting:**
- Clear monthly invoices
- Transparent expense documentation
- Regular property reports
- Easy communication

**Fee Structure:**
- Competitive rates
- Clear about what's included
- No hidden charges
- Aligned incentives

### Red Flags

Be cautious of:
- Vague pricing or hidden fees
- Poor communication during initial discussions
- Unwillingness to provide references
- High percentage rates (30%+)
- Pressure to sign long-term contracts

## Staff Requirements

### Essential Staff

**Cleaning Staff:**

- Between-guest deep cleaning
- Regular maintenance cleaning

**Gardening:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly visits
- Pool area maintenance
- Plant care and landscaping

**Pool Maintenance:**
- Regular chemical treatment
- Equipment maintenance
- Cleaning and debris removal

**Security:**
- Night security if location requires

### Staff Costs

Typical monthly costs (can be shared between properties):
- Cleaning: $100-200
- Gardening: $50-100
- Pool maintenance: $50-100

## Electricity Options

Understanding PLN (Indonesian electricity) is important:

### Prepaid (Token System)
- Buy tokens to add credit
- Meter beeps when running low
- Good for budget control
- Risk: Guests may run out of power

### Postpaid
- Monthly billing
- No risk of running out
- Recommended for rental properties

**Recommendation:** Use postpaid for rental villas. A guest running out of electricity at 3 AM leads to bad reviews.

## Internet Considerations

Reliable internet is essential for modern guests:

### Key Requirements

- 100 Mbps+ for digital nomad market
- Dedicated connection per property
- WiFi extenders for full coverage
