Instagram is probably the most
powerful marketing tool that you can
have for your project. We could
probably write an entire guide on how
to improve your Instagram account but
we are going to list the top tips to
improve your reach and success. 
Use the name of your villa for the
Instagram name. Within your profile,
you can list one website and this is
where you will insert a link to your
Airbnb account. If you have multiple
villas, you will have to create a Linktree
account as Instagram only allows for
one linked website. List your multiple
Airbnb listings on Linktree and put this
link on your Instagram account. 
Managing your Instagram account can
be a lot of work as we recommend you
to make one post and at least 3 stories
per day. We have managed our
Instagram accounts ourselves but we
also suggest using an independent
contractor to do this for you. 
You can set the posting guidelines and
they will do all the posting for you at
$200-300 USD per month. This is a nice
service if you are busy with another job. 
To build your following, we suggest you
offer a stay at your villa to premier
influencers (100k or more followers and
they must get more than 4000 likes per
post) when it’s not occupied by paid
guests.

You will need to be super direct and
request at least one dedicated post and
multiple stories with large sticker tags
showcasing the villa per day they stay
for free. 
We also recommend contacting
photographers and asking them if they
want to use your villa for photoshoots.
We currently charge $100-300 USD per
photoshoot so this is a nice way to
make some additional money.

We have been posting our villas on
Pinterest but honestly, it’s difficult to
see how many bookings or leads come
from this platform. We still recommend
posting your villa on Pinterest with links
to your Instagram and Airbnb accounts
as this will bring organic attention to
your accounts. You can simply post the
photos that were taken for your Airbnb
account and repost on Pinterest with a
description of your villa and hashtags
related to the post.

Having a website makes your rental
villa look just a little more professional.
We recommend keeping your website
super clean and to the point as you
want people to be funneled from this
to your Airbnb booking page. Include 8-
12 photos of your villa with a brief
description and then create a booking
button that takes the user to your
Airbnb booking page. 
You can also list the prices on your
website and accept direct cash
payments for bookings to avoid any
Airbnb booking fees. However, in our
experience, we don’t get a lot of direct
bookings from our website as most
direct bookings come from our
Instagram account.
