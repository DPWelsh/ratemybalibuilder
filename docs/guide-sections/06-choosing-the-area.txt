## Choosing the Right Area

Where do you want to build or buy? The simple answer is: build in the area you like most. That's generally the right approach.

However, different locations represent very different types of investments. Understanding these differences is crucial for your ROI.

## Popular Areas Compared

### Canggu

Canggu is currently one of the most popular areas in Bali. Its streets are busy with trendy restaurants, bars, local fashion stores, beach clubs, and more.

**Investment characteristics:**
- High rental demand (even during the pandemic)
- Higher demand = higher prices
- Land prices: approximately 19-30 Million IDR/Are/year (leasehold)
- One of the most expensive areas in Bali

### Uluwatu (Bingin Area)

Uluwatu isn't as popular as Canggu, but it has unique appeal. It's close to the best surf breaks in Bali and attracts surfers and those who appreciate cliff views and white sand beaches.

**Investment characteristics:**
- Quieter area with growing development
- New businesses opening regularly
- Land prices: 10-16 Million IDR/Are/year (leasehold)
- Potential for significant appreciation

Many investors believe the Uluwatu area is poised to become "the next Canggu" within a few years.

### Ubud

The cultural heart of Bali, known for rice terraces, temples, and wellness retreats.

**Investment characteristics:**
- Land prices: as low as 3.5 Million IDR/Are/year
- Different target market (wellness, culture, retreats)
- Lower tourist density but consistent demand

### Other Emerging Areas

Keep an eye on:
- **Babakan, Pantai Lima, Seseh** - located near Canggu
- **Kedungu** - north of the popular Tanah Lot Temple

## Investment Strategy

From an investor's perspective, you want to discover areas that:
- Aren't at peak popularity yet
- Show signs of becoming popular soon
- Offer favorable land prices relative to potential

Trust your instincts—if you sense an area is about to boom, investigate further.

However, if you find a good opportunity with appealing ROI calculations in an already popular area, don't hesitate. There are no strict rules here.

## Due Diligence Questions

Once you've identified an area, examine specific plots carefully:

### Zoning Compatibility
Does the land zoning fit your project? (Covered in detail in the Zoning chapter)

**Warning:** If an agent promises that changing zoning "won't be a problem," find a different agent.

### Neighboring Developments
- What's planned for adjacent properties?
- Will a multi-story building block your views?
- Will shared access roads create traffic during construction?

### Noise Factors
- Proximity to busy roads (can be mitigated with design)
- Nearby nightclubs, bars, or beach clubs
- Construction noise from neighboring projects

### Wildlife Considerations
- Monkeys in Ubud and Uluwatu areas (can be aggressive)
- Consider monkey-proofing in boundary wall design

### Environmental Factors
- Rice paddies nearby (burning season smoke, mosquitoes)
- Drainage patterns and flood risk
- Ground hardness for foundations

### Accessibility
- Distance to restaurants, shops, gyms
- Proximity to schools/daycare (if targeting families)
- Road access and quality
