## Finding a Construction Company

Finding the right construction company is one of the most critical decisions in your Bali investment journey. The quality of your builder directly impacts your project's success, timeline, and profitability.

## What to Look For

The most important criteria when evaluating builders:

### Honesty About Costs
- Transparent pricing for materials
- Clear breakdown of what's included
- No hidden fees or surprise charges
- Realistic quotes (not too low to be true)

### Construction Quality
- Proper techniques for Bali's climate
- Quality materials appropriate for tropical conditions
- Attention to waterproofing, foundations, and finishes
- Evidence of durability in previous projects

### Reliability
- Track record of completing projects on time
- Clear communication throughout the process
- References from satisfied clients
- Financial stability to complete your project

## Research Methods

### Visit Completed Projects

The best way to evaluate a builder:

1. **Request their portfolio** of completed projects
2. **Visit properties in person** if possible
3. **Look for projects 2+ years old** to see how they've held up

### What to Look For During Visits

**Walls:**
- Are there cracks?
- Signs of mold or water damage?
- Paint peeling or discoloration?

**Floors:**
- Cracked or chipped tiles?
- Uneven surfaces?
- Water pooling issues?

**Foundation:**
- Evidence of settling?
- Cracks at wall bases?
- Proper drainage?

**Roof:**
- Signs of leaking?
- Quality of waterproofing?
- Proper drainage systems?

**Doors and Windows:**
- Smooth operation?
- Signs of rust or warping?
- Quality of seals?

### Talk to Previous Clients

Ask property owners about their experience:
- Was the project completed on time?
- Were there unexpected costs?
- How did the builder handle problems?
- Would they use this builder again?
- How has the property held up?

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Unrealistic Pricing

**Warning:** If a quote is significantly lower than competitors, there's usually a reason:
- Substandard materials
- Hidden additional costs
- Corners being cut
- Financial instability

The saying "you get what you pay for" is especially true in Bali construction.

### Unrealistic Timelines

Be cautious of builders who:
- Promise to complete in unusually short timeframes
- Have a history of projects running over schedule
- Can't provide specific milestone timelines

Some builders promise 10-month completion but take 2+ years. Always get references.

### Unprofessional Behavior

During your meetings, watch for:
- Evasive answers about pricing or materials
- Promises that seem too good to be true
- Suggestions to bypass regulations or zoning
- Inability to provide documentation or references
- Unprofessional conduct during meetings

### Illegal Suggestions

**Walk away immediately** if a builder suggests:
- Building without proper PBG permits
- Ignoring zoning restrictions
- Using workarounds for regulations
- Any illegal or questionable practices

This indicates someone focused on making a sale, not on your project's success.

## Evaluating Construction Quality

If you're not a construction expert, consider hiring someone to help evaluate:

### Foundation Assessment
- Are foundations set on hard ground?
- Are cement columns and footings properly sized?
- Does the foundation depth match engineering requirements?
- Is there proper reinforcement with rebar?

### Waterproofing Inspection
- Is there proper membrane under walls and floors?
- Is roof waterproofing adequate (double-layer recommended)?
- Are walls coated to prevent moisture intrusion?

### Materials Quality
- What grade of materials is being used?
- Are materials appropriate for tropical conditions?
- Is galvanized steel used for doors and windows (prevents rust)?

## The Meeting Process

### Prepare Your Questions

Before meeting with potential builders:
- Know your budget range
- Have your design concepts ready
- List your must-have features
- Prepare questions about their process

### Key Questions to Ask

1. What is your per-square-meter rate, and what does it include?
2. What materials do you use for [specific elements]?
3. What is your typical timeline for a project this size?
4. Can you provide references from recent projects?
5. What warranty do you offer after completion?
6. How do you handle unexpected issues during construction?
7. What is your payment structure?
8. Will you be the primary contact, or will someone else manage the project?

### What to Expect in Pricing

Construction costs vary widely based on quality:

| Quality Level | Per m² Rate (IDR) | Per m² Rate (USD)* |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Basic | 4-6 million | $250-375 |
| Standard | 6-8 million | $375-500 |
| Premium | 8-12 million | $500-750 |
| Luxury | 12+ million | $750+ |

*Exchange rates vary; these are approximate

The difference comes from:
- Material quality
- Construction techniques
- Finishing details
- Warranty and support

## Making Your Selection

### Shortlist Process

1. Research and identify 5-10 potential builders
2. Review portfolios and eliminate obvious mismatches
3. Visit completed projects of top 3-5 candidates
4. Meet personally with top 3 candidates
5. Check references thoroughly
6. Make your selection based on complete evaluation

### Trust Your Instincts

Consider the personal relationship:
- You'll communicate with this person for a year or more
- Misunderstandings can be costly
- You need to feel comfortable raising concerns
- Choose someone you can work with long-term

## Professional Inspection Services

If you're not experienced in construction, consider hiring:
- A building inspector to evaluate potential builders' work
- A project consultant to help with selection
- An independent supervisor to oversee construction

The investment in professional assistance often saves money in the long run by avoiding poor construction choices.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Research thoroughly** - Don't rush the selection process
2. **Visit completed projects** - See the builder's work firsthand
3. **Talk to previous clients** - Get honest feedback
4. **Be wary of low quotes** - Cheap often means poor quality
5. **Check for red flags** - Unprofessional behavior, unrealistic promises
6. **Evaluate quality** - Focus on foundations, waterproofing, materials
7. **Consider the relationship** - You'll work together for months
8. **Get professional help** - If you're not a construction expert

Choosing the right builder is worth the time investment. A quality construction company protects your investment and ensures your project's long-term success.
