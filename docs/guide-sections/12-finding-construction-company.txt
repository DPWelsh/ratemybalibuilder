Most of the buyers of off-plan villas
prefer to pay by installments. Thus, it’s
important to create a payment plan
that will satisfy your prospects and you.
When you are selling your property off-
plan, you will want to receive all
payments by the end of the villa
construction. In this case, try to divide
the time that you have until the end of
construction into fractions and
distribute installments among them.
Once all payments are made, then you
can transfer the lease or freehold title
to the new buyer. Don’t do this before
all payments are made.

We don’t think you should choose
“either-or” but use both options to
make a sale. Either an agency will help
you to sell the villa or you sell it on your
own, you will be better off in both ways.
SELLING INDEPENDENTLY
VS. REAL ESTATE AGENTS
SELLING INDEPENDENTLY
If you have an extended database of
potential buyers or if you have a good
marketing budget, then you can try
selling your villa on your own. Based on
our experience, the process of selling
villas by yourself can be very time-
consuming but don’t get frustrated. We
have experience with buyers who we
were talking to for months and they
already put the deposit down but
ended up not buying the villa. 
On the other hand, some people would
have one meeting with us and then
they purchased the villa on the next
day. Whether it’s your second or 100th
meeting, you should have the same
positive attitude, because for your
potential customer this meeting is the
first one and he or she doesn’t need to
know about your exhausting previous
meetings. We do recommend asking
for a deposit on their purchase sooner
than later as this will help lock in your
sale.

VIDEO CALLS
If the potential buyer is overseas, it
makes sense to arrange a video call.
Make sure to send the buyer your
website link and your spreadsheet on
ROI before the call. Also, make it clear
to the prospect on how much you are
ready to negotiate the price, if at all,
and the payment plan. It is also
important to mention, before arranging
a call, that if the buyer is a foreigner, he
or she won’t be able to take a loan.
Clarifying all these points will filter
those people who either don’t have a
budget to make a purchase or are not
serious. It will save you a lot of time and
energy. Talking to numerous low-
quality prospects can make you feel
frustrated very fast. Many investors, who
feel this way, lower the price and sell
their beautiful villas for too cheap. It
always makes us feel sad when we see
this happening.
PERSONAL MEETINGS
If the potential buyer is in Bali, then you
can meet directly at the villa location.
Show them around the site if the villa is
still in the construction process. Have
your 3D designs ready to show the
buyers so they can see how different
rooms will look once the villa is built.
It's worth mentioning that if they
purchase the villa sooner, they can add
changes to the villa design. 
For example, one of our buyers
purchased the villa at the very early
stage of construction. She was very
excited to customize the design. On her
request, we changed the style of the
wall niches, made the dining table
larger, changed the poolside cabana
and fabrics for the sunken lounge. This
might look to you as an additional
hustle but we look at it as required
customer service and this is an essential
part of sales, especially if you price your
villa premium.

USING REAL ESTATE AGENTS
To save time, you can let the Real
Estate Agency take care of selling your
property. We have found that the
agencies will try to lower the price for
your villa because it’s then easier to sell.
You might be tempted to sell at the
lower price once they bring you a buyer
but we don’t recommend conceding to
their pressure. It’s important to agree
on terms with the agency from the very
beginning. If you’re not ready to lower
the price then make it clear. Otherwise,
they are wasting your time. 
 
Real Estate Agencies in Bali charge 5%
of the property price from the seller. If
you think that this rate is too high then
you can add 2,5% on top of the original
price. This way the agency will get a 5%
commission and you will get a higher
income from the sale.
