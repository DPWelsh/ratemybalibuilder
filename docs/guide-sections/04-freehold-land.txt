PT PMA COMPANY
OWNERSHIP
Buying land through establishing an
investment company (PT PMA) is what
we recommend if you're a foreigner.
You will need to start by creating a
foreign investment company first. To
save your time on this process, we
suggest using an agency or a
professional who will take care of all
the necessary procedures. 
Henry is our business consultant, he has
a lot of experience and speaks perfect
English. Contact him and he will help
you to set up a company and get you a
KITAS. Please note that this takes
approximately 2 months to complete
so we recommend initiating this
process sooner than later if you want to
buy freehold land or property. One of
the requirements for a PT PMA
company is that the company should
hold a minimum of 10 Billion IDR of
assets. This is a significant amount of
money and we recommend talking to
Henry about how to show these assets
on your corporation's books (+62 812
3855 3133). 
Then, when you are ready to purchase
the freehold land or property, the title
will be signed over to your company by
a notary at the time of sale. 
11
Make at PT PMA Company first.
Purchase the land in the name of
the PT PMA Company.
Convert the land certificate to HGB
under the name of PT PMA
Company.
When an Indonesian citizen buys land
the title is called SHM (Sertifikat Hak
Milik) or Freehold Title in English. When
an Indonesian citizen buys through a
company (PT), the title is called HGB
(Hak Guna Bangunan) or Building Right
Title in English. With a foreign-owned
company (PT PMA) the title is the same
as with a locally owned company (PT)
and is called HGB. Both Freehold title
and Building right title are the same
status and own the land forever.  
In summary, if you are a foreigner that
wants to buy Freehold Title:

Hot Tip: To make freehold land less
accessible to foreigners, the Indonesian
government released a law that
prevents foreigners from getting a
building permit if the land is less than
10 Are (1000 m2). Simply put, you will
never get your IMB approved if your
land plot is too small. Of course, you
can buy 10 Are or more in freehold and
build your personal home on it and
maybe another villa or two. It’s all about
your budget after all.

SELLING
FREEHOLD
Besides the obvious advantage that the
land will be at your disposal with no
limit of time, there is another benefit
that makes freehold title so attractive
to investors. If you are building
properties for sale, freehold allows you
to sell units to a wide range of
customer groups. You can sell the
freehold to Indonesians, who prefer to
buy freehold property and can get a
mortgage at the bank. You can also sell
to foreigners with a PT PMA company
or lease the land to foreigners for the
agreed amount of time.

SELECTING
LAND
Water pump rooms and water tanks
(can be underground)
Parking space (car or scooter)
Utility room for the cleaning staff,
gardener, PLN box/es (often forgotten)
Enclosed garbage area
Private road access (to become more
exclusive)
Room for night security 
Laundry and storage room
A playground (becoming more
popular for families)
Let’s start with the basics. What land size
should you go for? Obviously, you are
limited by your budget. However, even if
you have a budget for a large piece of
land, you shouldn't just splurge for it.
Don’t get too excited, think like a CEO of
a big company. Every square meter of the
land must bring value to the property
and help you to sell or rent it at a higher
price. In short, before deciding how big
your land plot should be, answer two
questions: What is my overall budget?
What concept do I want to build?  
Your budget determines how simple or
luxurious your property is going to be.
Apart from the villa, you will need
additional space for the following:

A private wide road (5 m wide) with
palm trees on the sides.
We separated the villa's utility area
with a building for cleaning and
gardening supplies, unit storage
closets, PLN boxes, garbage bins,
and a security building.
We even designed a playground for
children as we determine our
customer audience as families with
kids. Actually, for the playground,
we got the biggest feedback from
our buyers. They said it's a unique
feature that no other villas have. A
great example that shows how
important it is to understand your
target (who are you building for).
Such a small and inexpensive twist
like adding a playground gave us a
massive return as it helped us to sell
villas without real estate agents’
help.
It also depends on the price of the land.
If you have found a great land plot at a
very good price, get a bigger plot and
make a pool area bigger or surround
villas with plants, all these will make
your project more attractive to the
buyers and raise your villas price tag. 
For example, we designed the following
elements into our The Young Villas
Uluwatu project of seven villas: 
The land size also depends on the
location you want to build in. Often,
landowners prefer not to break the land
into small plots and prefer to sell larger
plots at once to one buyer. Especially, if
the land plot is located on the first line
from the beach or cliffside in Uluwatu.
If prime location is a major factor for
you, we suggest you find someone else
to buy a bigger land plot with or buy a
villa from someone else’s subdivided
project.
When looking for a land plot, get on
your bike and drive around the area you
like. You might find a plot that your
land agent didn't know about or maybe
it's not even listed yet. 
Hot tip: Install a GPS Fields Area
Measure App on your phone. It will help
you to calculate the size of the plot
your are looking at, its distance from
any spot on the map, and save the land
that you found in your favorites. You
can even share the plot you found and
it's parameters with the land agent in
one click.

CHOOSING
THE AREA
Where do you want to build or buy?
This seems to be an easy question,
build in the area that you like the most.
We believe it's the right approach. This
is how we do as well. We build in areas
we love the most like Canggu and
Bingin. However, these two locations
are very different types of investment.
   
Canggu is currently one of the most
popular areas in Bali. Its streets are busy
with trendy restaurants and bars, local
fashion stores, beach clubs, and more.
The demand for a rental property in
Canggu was high even during the
pandemic. Higher demand means
higher prices. Thus, the land in Canggu
is one of the most expensive in Bali. In
comparison, leasehold land in Canggu
costs approximately between 19 to 30
Million IDR/Are/year; leasehold land in
Bingin is between 10-16 Mil
IDR/Are/year, land in Ubud can be as
low as 3.5 Mil IDR/Are/year.
15
On the other hand, Bingin in Uluwatu is
not as popular as Canggu, however, it
has its own beauty. Bingin is close to
the best surf breaks in Bali and attracts
surfers and those who appreciate
beautiful cliff views and white sand
beaches. Bingin seems to be a quiet
area but, if you give it a closer look, you
will see that there are a lot of new
businesses opening up as more and
more people are coming there. Lower
land prices give businesses a good
opportunity to invest now with a
greater return in the future. We believe
that Bingin is going to be “The Next
Canggu” in a couple of years. Other
interesting areas are Babakan, Panti
Lima, and Seseh which are located next
to Canggu, and Kedungu which is
North of the popular Tanah Lot Temple.
From the perspective of the investor,
you want to discover areas that are not
at the peak of popularity yet but will be
there very soon (what your guts say?).
However, if you see a good opportunity
and your calculated ROI is appealing,
go for the popular area. There are no
strict rules for it.

IMPORTANT
QUESTIONS TO ASK
Does the land zoning fit your
project? We will talk in more detail
about the zoning later on. Let us tell
you one thing now - if the agent
promises that changing the zoning
won’t be a problem or that you can
build despite the wrong zoning,
change the agent. This person has
no interest in providing you with the
right land plot but making a sale. 
Who is building next to you? The
land next door might be currently
vacant and have a nice view,
however, you never know who is
going to buy the land and what they
are going to build. If there is a
planned five-story apartment
project building next door, you will
have to turn your property
overlooking the other way or not
have a view at all. If you are sharing
the exit road, be ready that it will be
always busy. Especially, if this
apartment project will take way
longer to build than your villas.
Trucks going there and back and
construction noise might prevent
you from selling or renting your
property at a premium price. This
leads us to the next question.
Once you determine the area, give a
closer look at the land plots that your
agent offers to you. Ask yourself the
next questions:
16
Is there a noisy road close to the
plot? Of course, this should not be a
major deal breaker but you should
consider it when designing your
project. For example, you can put a
natural wall of trees and greenery
between the road and the villas or
decrease the noise inside the
building. Don’t put any windows
from the side of the road and
soundproofing can be installed
behind your wall and ceiling to
dampen the noise. Smart design
can overcome this problem. 
Is there local wildlife? In areas of
Ubud and Uluwatu, there are
monkeys that are natural residents
of the land. They may seem cute at
first but they can be extremely
aggressive with dogs and children.
Monkeys in Bali have been known to
bite people and can enter villas to
steal things from inside. There are
some monkey proofing measures
that you can design into your villa's
boundary walls in these areas to
prevent monkeys from entering your
property but it’s something to know
before buying.
