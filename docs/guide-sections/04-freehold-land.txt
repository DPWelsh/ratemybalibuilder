## Freehold Land Ownership

Freehold land is "yours" forever. A small correction: it's not technically yours, but rather your company's asset if you are a foreign buyer.

We ran a poll on Instagram asking our followers if they prefer buying freehold or leasehold land, considering that freehold requires over double the investment. Surprisingly, 68% of respondents chose freehold.

This way of land acquisition might be more desirable for the majority as you get to keep the land forever. In reality, freehold works best for more serious investors with larger buying power and Indonesian citizens. If you just want to build your personal home in Bali and your budget is tight, leasehold will work best for you.

## Buying Freehold as a Foreigner

There are two ways of acquiring freehold land in Indonesia as a foreigner:
1. Through an Indonesian nominee
2. Through a locally registered PT PMA company

We recommend that you consult an experienced and recommended notary before buying any property.

### Nominee Ownership (Not Recommended)

This method of "purchasing" property by foreigners in Indonesia has been used for a long time. However, it is extremely risky as the Indonesian nominee can try to withdraw the agreement and there are no guarantees that this will not be approved by an untrustworthy notary.

You also have to trust your nominee completely to use this method. We don't believe this risk is justified, so **we don't recommend it**.

For educational purposes, here's how nominee ownership works:
- A loan agreement is established between a foreigner and a local Indonesian nominee for the price of the land
- Full and irrevocable power of attorney is signed by the nominee, waiving their rights over the land
- The power of attorney allows the foreigner to use, sell, transfer, or lease the land without permission from the nominee
- The power of attorney must be fully transferable so the foreigner may pass ownership to someone else
- An agreement gives the foreigner permanent rights to occupy and use the land
- The original land certificate is held by the foreigner

**The problem:** The whole concept of "nominee" land acquisition is a way to get around Indonesian law. Even if the nominee is trustworthy, you will have problems getting PBG permits, selling, or renting out the property legally as you may need their approval to complete these processes.

### PT PMA Company Ownership (Recommended)

Buying land through establishing an investment company (PT PMA) is what we recommend for foreigners. You will need to create a foreign investment company first.

To save time on this process, we suggest using an agency or professional who will take care of all necessary procedures. This process takes approximately 2 months to complete, so we recommend initiating it early if you want to buy freehold land.

**Key requirement:** A PT PMA company must hold a minimum of 10 Billion IDR in assets. This is significant, and we recommend consulting with a business advisor about how to structure this properly.

When you're ready to purchase the freehold land or property, the title will be signed over to your company by a notary at the time of sale.

### Understanding Land Titles

- **SHM (Sertifikat Hak Milik)** - Freehold Title for Indonesian citizens
- **HGB (Hak Guna Bangunan)** - Building Right Title for companies (both PT and PT PMA)

Both titles effectively mean you own the land forever.

### Summary: Steps to Buy Freehold as a Foreigner

1. Establish a PT PMA Company first
2. Purchase the land in the name of the PT PMA Company
3. Convert the land certificate to HGB under the name of PT PMA Company

### Important: Minimum Land Size

To make freehold land less accessible to foreigners, the Indonesian government released a law preventing foreigners from getting a building permit if the land is less than 10 Are (1,000 m²).

Simply put, you will never get your building permit approved if your land plot is too small. Of course, you can buy 10 Are or more in freehold and build your personal home plus maybe another villa or two. It's all about your budget.

## Selling Freehold Property

Besides the obvious advantage that the land will be at your disposal with no time limit, there's another benefit that makes freehold attractive to investors.

If you're building properties for sale, freehold allows you to sell to a wider range of customer groups:
- **Indonesian citizens** who prefer freehold property and can obtain bank mortgages
- **Foreigners with PT PMA companies** who can purchase directly
- **Foreign individuals** to whom you can lease the land for an agreed period

This flexibility significantly expands your potential buyer pool.
