Electricity: There are two types of
PLN electricity payment options in
Indonesia Prepaid and Postpaid. If
you're more budget conscious and
would like to have more control over
your electricity consumption, then
Prepaid electricity can be a great
option for you. The installation
process is simpler and fast. You
builder will send the request to the
PLN company and they will install a
special meter for your villa that you
will have to top up with tokens
regularly. Once you run out of
tokens, the meter will start making a
beeping noise until it's topped up.  
 If you are building a villa for daily
rentals, the Postpaid electricity is
highly recommended. Make sure
your builder submits the request to
the PLN company at least 3 months
before the end of the construction
as they might request additional
documents. Once the request is
approved, the PLN company will
install electrical boxes with a meter
that you will have to pay once a
month. This option will work better
for rental villas as your guests will
never run out of electricity in the
middle of the night and give you a
bad review because it was too hot
for them to sleep without a working
AC.

Internet: Getting high speed
internet in Bali can be painful.
Unfortunately, there are not so many
options in Bingin and others areas in
Bali so you have to work with what
you have. We installed a dedicated
modem in every villa and also put
WIFI enhancing devises to
strangthan the Wifi connection. We
made a critical mistake with our 10
one bedroom Suites project. It was
suggested by the internet provider
to install one network system for all
10 Suites instead of putting a
dedicated modem for each Suite. As
the result, we were paying a 1
million IDR fee monthly per Suite
but the speed of the internet was 10
Mbps instead of the promised 100
Mbps. What a difference! Hehe. After
long discussions with the internet
provider, we realized that they won't
fix it and we just had to install a
completely new system at our cost.
Eventually, we installed dedicated
modems in every suite as we did in
other projects. Now we pay half the
price per month and have a much
better connection than before.  In
Canggu the situation is a little bit
better but you will have to shop and
ask around before making your
decision on what provider to use,

IMB is now replaced by PBG. 
PBG, like the IMB, is a mandatory
permit for anyone who wants to build a
new building, change / renovate a
building, or maintain a building. The
difference between PBG and IMB is
related to the permit application before
starting the construction. PBG does not
require building owners to apply for a
permit before constructing a building,
like the previous IMB regulations.
Unlike the IMB, PBG acts as a licensing
rule that regulates how buildings
should be built.
The term PBG stands for “Persetujuan
Bangunan Gedung” which literally
means “Building Construction
Authorization”. The  Government says
that PBG can be issued within 2 days
but it seems to be too good to be true
and, in reality, you might have to wait
for it a little bit longer. Thus, it’s better
to apply right after your architectural
design is ready. 
If you want to increase your chances of
getting your PBG approved, we suggest
taking consultations from an
experienced builder who knows about
all the requirements you have to
consider when designing your project.
PBG requirements (like IMB) are
expected to be changing quite often
and are different in different areas of
Bali, so it’s hard to keep up with all the
rules and stay updated. 
PBG BUILDING PERMIT 
43
The PBG specifications outline the
design of the roof, the number of floors,
the percentage of land that can be
developed, and the style of the
building. For example, you probably
won’t get your PBG approved if you
submit a design of a five stories
apartment building with a flat roof on
the small land plot.

APPLICATION PROCESS 
44
Information on Applicant or Owner
Data
Building data
Technical plan documents
Registration
Inspection of compliance with
technical standards
Compliance Statement
Steps to apply for PBG:
1. Submit technical plan document to
district / city / provincial government
before the construction began.
2. After the document is checked and
approved, you will have to submit: 
3. Registration is carried out by the
applicant or owner through the SIMBG
(Building Management Information
System).
4. After the information is declared
complete, the Secretariat provides a
schedule for planning consultations.
 
The consultation process includes:
5. The last examination is accompanied
by a conclusion on the
recommendation to issue a
Compliance Statement with Technical
Standards or a recommendation for re-
registration of PBG.
In addition to PBG, a Proof of Building
Ownership (SBKBG) and Building
Feasibility Certificate (SLF) documents
are needed which have to be renewed
within 5 years for non-residential
buildings and 20 years for residential
buildings.
Before designing our latest large-scale
project in Uluwatu, we spent hours in
the IMB (now PBG) office discussing
what type of project that we could
build, at what scale, and what design
limitations we have to consider. 
We suggest you save time and hire a
consultant or an experienced builder
who will help you to submit an
architectural design that meets all the
requirements. Get your PBG stressless
and start building the project on time.

FINDING CONSTRUCTION
COMPANY 
It took us a long time to find a good
construction company in Bali. The most
important criteria are honesty about
the cost of the materials, quality of the
construction techniques, and reliability.
To find a good contractor, we visited
several properties that we like to see
how they are built and asked our
contacts for recommendations. We also
talked personally to the managers of
the construction companies as well as
the owners of the villas they built for. 
You can contact several companies and
ask them about their portfolios to see
what they have done before and what
kind of project types they are good at.
Visit some of the properties if you can
and pay attention to the quality of the
materials that are used. If the building
is not new, what do the walls look like?
Are there cracks all over it and are there
signs of mold in the walls? How about
the floor? Are the tiles cracked or
chipped? What kind of foundation do
they set? Is it just a rock foundation or
do they also install cement columns
with large footings until to the depth
where the hard ground is reached? Do
they waterproof a roof or not? 
45
All these details and many more talk
about the quality that the company can
provide. If you don’t understand a lot
about the construction, bring someone
who knows how it should be done. We
offer consulting services and can visit a
site for you to complete an inspection.
Once you have your top three
companies that you would consider
hiring, arrange personal meetings with
the contractors. One contractor we met
with was drinking beer during the
meeting so we did not feel comfortable
trusting our construction process to a
professional like this. Another manager
was giving us promises that were not in
his power and were illegal to execute.
For instance, he said that we can
definitely get a villa PBG if we want to
build in a green zone. This is a sign to
us that this person is not interested in a
project's success and if the construction
will be “frozen” because a PBG was
declined, he would not care and move
onto another project. 


--- PAGE 48 ---

We ended up choosing a company that
had experience in building projects
similar to what we want to build. The
contractor was very open about the
pricing and the materials that are used
for the construction. He can build a
project for us for 10 mil IDR per square
meter or for 4 mil IDR, the difference in
pricing comes down to the quality of
the materials used and the
construction techniques. Thus, if we
want to have a good quality villa, we
should use better quality materials that
are more expensive. To build our villas,
we use the best quality materials and
pay the highest price to the contractor.
The old saying holds true in Bali and
you definitely get what you pay for. Be
cautious of contractors that give you
too low of a quote as there may be
more costs that are not being
accounted for. We have heard horror
stories of contractors promising they
would complete the building in under
10 months and end up taking over 2
years, so make sure you get a couple of
references.
The contractor had not just answered
our questions but also told us a lot of
useful information that helped us to
make an educated decision about the
project. It’s important not to just have
good relationships with the contractor
but also to be comfortable talking to
him to make sure you’re on the same
page. You will have to communicate
with this person regularly for at least a
year and any occurring
misunderstandings can cost you a lot of
money.

CONTRACT WITH BUILDING
CONTRACTOR
When negotiating a contract with the
contractor, clarify what exactly is
included in the construction cost. Is the
builder contractor only responsible for
the basics and the rest will have to be
done at an additional cost? For
example, our villa design has wall
niches and a sunken lounge in the
living room, is this cost included in the
contract? Many builders do not include
the cost of building out the kitchen,
building built-in closets, and custom
furniture. If you want these items to be
included in your contract you need to
specify the quality of the finished
product as this can change the price
drastically. You may want to go
shopping for tile, bathroom, and
kitchen fixtures yourself to ensure you
are getting exactly the quality finishes
that you want.
47
Foundations and roofs are not exciting
things but they are extremely
important in Bali due to the soil quality
and the amount of annual rainfall. You
will want to make sure that a
geological survey is completed before
signing the contract so your builder can
know how deep they need to set the
foundations. We recommend setting
deep cement column foundations with
large rebar reinforced cement footing
to ensure the building does not
develop large cracks and is structurally
sound when it experiences an
earthquake. We also recommend that
you agree and sign off on what roofing
and roof waterproofing material that
you will use to ensure that your roof
does not leak. There is a widespread in
costs when comparing roofing
materials so make sure you know what
is included. For cement roofs, we
recommend using a double
waterproofing technique that first uses
a thin layer of cement waterproofing
material that is overlaid with a second
layer of bitumen sheets that will be
sealed onto your roof with a heat gun.
Most builders will only add the first
layer of cement waterproofing material
which we do not recommend. 


--- PAGE 50 ---

We recommend structuring the
contract that the payments are made
on a defined schedule based on what is
completed on the villa. Pay 25-30%
upfront and then pay the remainder
when you reach building milestones
like completing the roof or installing
the tiles. Ensure that you don’t pay too
much upfront and agree that you will
not pay 10-20% of the remaining total
cost until the project is 100%
completed. We also recommend
including a penalty statement into the
contract that states that if the building
is not completed on time then the
builder will not receive the 5-10% of the
build cost and this is removed from the
final payment. 
 
We highly recommend that you go with
an experienced builder that will offer a
one-year warranty after the building is
completed. Make sure it is documented
what is included in this one-year
warranty. With even the most
experienced builders and deep-set
foundations, there will be small cracks
that will form in the plasterwork on
your walls during the first year after
construction. Superficial wall cracks are
normal and ensure that it is detailed in
your contract that they will come back
in one year to fix these cracks. This
typically takes 1-2 days to fix the crack
in the wall and you will never know that
they were there.

THE BUILDING PROCESS
SUPERVISING
CONSTRUCTION 
You’ve got your PBG, congratulations!
Now you can finally start the
construction you’ve been preparing for
so long. If you are new to the building
or are trying to manage this project
from overseas, we recommend that you
hire a building supervisor to oversee the
construction process. We recommend
that you hire a westerner to be your
building supervisor if you want your
villa to be built to a higher standard.
Most building supervisors charge
between 10-20% of the building cost.
Although this is a relatively high cost,
we recommend doing this if you have
never built before. We offer these
services to many of our clients. In
addition, building in Indonesia is unlike
building in western countries as other
techniques are used in the building
process that may seem odd to do in
other areas of the world. An
experienced supervisor will work with
you to ensure that no shortcuts are
taken no matter what the building
process is here in Bali.

Measurements: We have checked
all the measurements on our
projects and we have caught a lot of
mistakes in the measurements of
our foundations when the building
has started.
Concrete Mixture Ratios: Ensure
that the workers are using the
correct ratios of cement, sand, and
gravel in the concrete as specified
by the architect.
Roofing Materials and
Waterproofing:  You will need to
get on the roof, if possible, to see if
the roofing waterproofing has been
installed properly. Ensure that
proper waterproofing is applied to
all exterior walls and places where
moisture might collect.
Plumbing & Electrical: You will
need to ensure that the plumbing
and electrical plans match the
architectural drawings.
Foundations: Check if the
foundation footings are set on hard
ground and the foundation columns
match engineering drawings
(dimensions and location). 
You or your building supervisor will
need to check all the following on-site
details against the plans:

INTERIOR DECORATING
Interior decorating might not be
everyone's specialty and this is a critical
step that many people think that they
can do by themselves. If you are not
confident in your interior decoration
skills, we recommend that you contact
a professional. 
Marie is a French interior designer that
is located in Bali and she has helped us
out before on several projects (see
p.70). She can work with you to come
up with a mood board to collect all of
your ideas and bring them together
into a finished product. She knows all
of the best suppliers and can get you
interior design items and custom
furniture. We highly recommend her
services as she will make decorating
your villa much less stressful. 
51
If you are more of the artistic type and
don’t mind sourcing items yourself,
then we recommend using our large
list of recommended suppliers that is
located at the end of this guide. We
have become quite popular in Bali and
we have partnered with a lot of other
brands. This guide will easily pay for
itself many times over if you use our
recommended list of suppliers for
purchasing interior decor items. The
one thing that we recommend doing is
sticking to one theme and color pallet
throughout your villa. Remember that
sometimes less is more as you don’t
want the villa to seem cluttered with
unnecessary stuff.

YOU ARE A PROPERTY
OWNER IN BALI
VILLA MANAGEMENT 
We have used Little Island Villa
management for all of our villas in Bali.
They make owning a rental villa super
easy as they do all the check-ins, hiring
and training off staff, pay salaries to the
staff, and paying for electricity and
other services. The management
company can also plan airport pick-ups,
in-house chefs, nannies, surf and yoga
lessons, transportation rentals, and
massages. They produce an easy-to-
understand monthly invoice that
documents all of the expenses and,
therefore, you will only need to pay one
account each month for all expenses
related to your villa. Little Island Villa
Management charges a flat monthly
rate per bedroom that your villa has.
52
There are many villa management
companies in Bali that charge a 25-30%
rate on all bookings and they use this
money to pays all expenses. We don’t
recommend doing this as you are
giving away all of your upside potentials
to the villa the management company
and they will make a higher return than
you. We recommend that you manage
your Airbnb account and your villa
bookings if you have time or we could
do this job for you. For a 15% marketing
fee, we will manage your villa on Airbnb
account and bookings. This is much
more reasonable than the 25-30% rate
that other companies are currently
charging in Bali.
