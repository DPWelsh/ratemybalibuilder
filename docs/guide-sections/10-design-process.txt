## The Design Process

You may have a dream villa in mind, but before building it, ask yourself a critical question: **Will this design appeal to the market?** This chapter guides you through creating a design that's both beautiful and profitable.

## Getting Inspired

### Research the Competition

Before designing, study successful properties:

1. **Ask around** - What are people's favorite villas in your price segment?
2. **Search Airbnb** - Find highly-rated properties in your target area
3. **Analyze what works** - Study their occupancy, pricing, reviews, and design
4. **Find at least five comparable properties** - Understand what makes them popular

### Questions to Answer
- What do successful properties have in common?
- Is there an underserved niche in the market?
- What could differentiate your property from competitors?
- What design elements attract the highest bookings?

### Creating a Mood Board

Use Pinterest and design platforms to collect inspiration:

1. **Save photos you like** in organized folders
2. **Stay consistent** with one design style (don't mix Mediterranean with Balinese with Industrial)
3. **Consider Bali's climate** when choosing designs—some concepts work better in tropical environments
4. **Think about photography** - Instagram-worthy features drive bookings

## Working with a Designer

Unless you're a professional, **hire an architect or designer**. Here's how to work with them effectively:

### Before the Meeting
- Have your Pinterest mood board ready
- Know your budget constraints
- Understand your target customer
- Be clear about must-have features

### During the Process
- Show rather than explain—visual references prevent misunderstandings
- Be open to professional suggestions—some designs need adaptation for Bali's climate
- Discuss maintenance requirements for different design choices
- Consider both aesthetics and functionality

## Bali-Specific Design Considerations

### Climate Adaptations

**Roof Overhangs**
Large overhangs are essential in Bali:
- Create shade and reduce indoor heat
- Lower air conditioning costs
- Protect walls from rain damage
- Keep bird and bat droppings off walls and windows

**Rain Management**
Bali receives heavy rainfall:
- Install efficient drainage systems
- Use quality roofing materials
- Add rain gutters
- Install waterproof membranes under walls and floors

### Open vs. Enclosed Living

This is a critical decision:

**Open Concept**
- Traditional Bali style
- Better natural ventilation
- Lower AC costs
- Closer connection to nature
- **Drawbacks:** Insects, bats, snakes, mosquitoes, less privacy

**Enclosed Concept** (Recommended)
- More comfortable for long-term living
- Better for families with children
- Easier to control temperature
- Preferred by modern renters
- Can use large sliding glass doors for flexibility

**Hybrid Approach:**
Install large sliding glass doors that can fully open or close. Guests get the open-air feeling when desired and can fully enclose spaces at night or during hot afternoons.

### Practical Spaces

Don't forget essential utility areas:

**Storage Room**
- Cleaning supplies
- Extra bedding and towels
- Guest luggage storage
- Owner's personal items when not in residence

**Laundry Area**
- Dedicated space for washing machine
- Consider in-villa laundry to protect guest clothing from external services

**Staff Areas**
- Cleaning supplies storage
- Staff rest area during long shifts

**Parking**
- Ensure adequate car parking (not just scooters)
- Essential for families and Jakarta visitors

## Technical Design Elements

### Air Conditioning Placement
- Position units above doorways (less visible)
- Partially recess into ceiling if possible
- Never place directly above beds (condensation, direct airflow)
- Install in every room except bathrooms

### Covered Outdoor Areas
- Protect outdoor furniture from sun damage
- Provide shelter from rain
- Reduce bird dropping cleanup
- Create usable outdoor living space

### Soundproofing
- Insulate ceilings in peaked-roof designs
- Reduces noise from roosters, traffic, rain, construction
- Also improves AC efficiency
- Locate pumps away from bedrooms (ideally underground)

### Waterproofing
Essential for Bali's humid climate:
- Coat walls from mid-height to floor
- Install membrane between walls and floor
- Use quality waterproofing on roofs
- Prevents mold, which is common in poorly-built villas

### Termite Protection
- Apply termite protection granules before floor waterproofing
- Not standard practice but essential for long-term protection
- Much easier to prevent than to treat later

## Materials for Tropical Climate

Choose materials that withstand Bali's environment:

| Material | Use | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Ironwood** | Pool decks | Most water and sun-resistant |
| **Recycled Teak** | Ceilings, doors, furniture | Durable, beautiful, apply water-based seal |
| **Limestone** | Feature walls | Needs anti-mold treatment annually |
| **Greenstone** | Pool tiles | Test tiles in pool water before bulk purchase |
| **Galvanized Steel** | Doors, windows | Expensive but doesn't rust or warp |
| **Terrazzo** | Countertops, pots | Must use quality supplier to prevent cracking |
| **Polished Cement** | Floors, sunken lounges | May crack; paint to hide color changes |

## Privacy Considerations

Protect your investment from future developments:

- Don't rely on views of vacant land—it may be developed
- Design for privacy even if currently unnecessary
- Consider sight lines from potential neighboring buildings
- Keep buildings single-story where possible
- Face villas toward common access roads rather than property lines

## Creating Signature Features

Make your villa memorable and Instagram-worthy:

- Unique pool design
- Feature walls with distinctive materials
- Custom cabanas or lounging areas
- Dramatic lighting elements
- Architectural focal points

These features:
- Drive social media exposure
- Make your property instantly recognizable
- Justify premium pricing
- Create lasting impressions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Research before designing**—understand what the market wants
2. **Hire professionals**—good design pays for itself
3. **Design for Bali's climate**—not just aesthetics
4. **Choose enclosed designs**—preferred by modern renters
5. **Use quality materials**—cheaper options cost more long-term

Great design combines beauty with practicality. In Bali's tropical environment, this balance is especially important for long-term success.
