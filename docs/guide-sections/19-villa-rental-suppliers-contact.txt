of them), show the design that you
want and Andy will find the right
fabric for you.
If you have a big order, make sure to
tell Andy how much exactly you need

Casa Uma Home Gallery offers a great
selection of bathroom and kitchen
fixtures. We recommend getting Toto
bathroom fixtures as they have seemed
to be the most durable for the bail
environment. You will need to order in
advance as many items need lead time.
At the front of the store, they also have a
large selection of ceramic and granite
floor tiles.  Ask the staff when they are
having a sale as it's possible to buy some
items including tiles at up to 40% off. The
