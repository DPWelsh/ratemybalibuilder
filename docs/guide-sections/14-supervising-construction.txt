## Supervising Construction

Once your PBG is approved and construction begins, proper supervision ensures your project meets expectations. This chapter covers what to monitor, when to intervene, and whether to hire professional oversight.

## The Importance of Supervision

Even with an excellent builder, supervision is essential because:

- **Mistakes happen** - Early detection prevents costly fixes
- **Quality varies** - Workers may cut corners without oversight
- **Specifications matter** - Ensuring your contract is followed
- **Communication gaps** - Bridging cultural and language differences

## Hiring a Building Supervisor

### When to Consider Professional Supervision

You should strongly consider hiring a supervisor if:

- You're new to construction projects
- You'll be managing the project from overseas
- You want your villa built to a higher standard
- You don't have time for regular site visits
- You're not familiar with local construction practices

### What Supervisors Do

A professional building supervisor will:

- **Visit the site regularly** (daily or several times per week)
- **Verify work against plans** and specifications
- **Check material quality** before and during installation
- **Document progress** with photos and reports
- **Communicate issues** to you and the builder
- **Ensure no shortcuts** are taken
- **Verify milestones** before you release payments

### Cost of Supervision

Building supervisors typically charge:
- **10-20% of building cost** for full supervision
- **Flat fees** for specific inspections

While this seems expensive, quality supervision often:
- Prevents costly mistakes
- Catches issues before they become problems
- Gives you peace of mind
- Saves money in the long run

### Finding a Supervisor

Look for supervisors who:
- Have experience in Bali construction
- Understand local building practices
- Can communicate in your language
- Have references from previous projects
- Are independent from your builder

**Tip:** Consider hiring a Western supervisor if you want your villa built to international standards. They understand both local practices and Western expectations.

## What to Check During Construction

Whether supervising yourself or working with a professional, these elements require verification:

### Foundation Phase

**Measurements:**
- Verify foundation dimensions match architectural drawings
- Check location of all columns and footings
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment

**Depth:**
- Confirm foundations reach hard ground
- Verify depth matches geological survey recommendations
- Check that foundation columns are properly sized

**Materials:**
- Correct rebar sizing and placement
- Proper concrete mix ratios
- Quality of materials being used

### Structural Phase

**Concrete Mixture:**
- Ensure workers use correct ratios of cement, sand, and gravel
- Verify ratios match architect specifications
- Check consistency across the project

**Steel Reinforcement:**
- Proper rebar placement in walls and columns
- Correct tying and spacing
- Adequate coverage by concrete

### Roofing Phase

**Materials:**
- Quality of roofing materials
- Proper installation techniques
- Adequate drainage slope

**Waterproofing:**
- First layer properly applied
- Second layer (bitumen) correctly sealed
- Coverage complete with no gaps

**Note:** You may need to get on the roof to verify waterproofing quality. Don't skip this—roof leaks are expensive to fix.

### Plumbing and Electrical

**Before Walls Close:**
- Verify plumbing layout matches plans
- Check electrical routing and outlet locations
- Ensure adequate pipe sizing
- Confirm proper drainage connections

**Quality Checks:**
- Proper materials used (appropriate for tropical conditions)
- Secure connections and fittings
- Correct slope for drainage pipes

### Walls and Waterproofing

**Wall Construction:**
- Plumb and level verification
- Proper mortar application
- Window and door openings correctly positioned

**Waterproofing:**
- Membrane installed between floor and walls
- Walls coated from mid-height to floor
- Extra protection in bathrooms and pool areas

### Finishes

**Tiles and Flooring:**
- Proper leveling and spacing
- Quality of grout application
- No cracked or chipped tiles

**Painting:**
- Proper surface preparation
- Quality of paint application
- Complete coverage

**Fixtures:**
- Correct products installed (match specifications)
- Proper installation and secure mounting
- Working condition verified

## Building in Bali vs. Western Countries

Understanding local practices helps you supervise effectively:

### Different Doesn't Mean Wrong

Some Bali construction techniques differ from Western methods:
- Different foundation approaches for local soil conditions
- Traditional materials and methods that work well in tropical climates
- Local solutions to local problems

### When to Question

Intervene when:
- Work clearly differs from architectural plans
- Materials don't match contract specifications
- Obvious shortcuts are being taken
- Quality concerns are visible

### Cultural Considerations

Effective supervision requires:
- Clear, respectful communication
- Understanding of local work practices
- Patience with language barriers
- Written documentation of concerns

## Regular Site Visits

If supervising yourself:

### Visit Frequency
- **Foundation phase:** Multiple times per week
- **Structural phase:** At least twice per week
- **Finishing phase:** Weekly minimum

### What to Bring
- Copy of architectural plans
- Contract and specifications
- Camera or phone for photos
- Notebook for documentation
- Measuring tape

### Documentation
- Photograph progress at each visit
- Note any concerns or deviations
- Keep records of conversations
- Document milestone completion

## Handling Problems

### When Issues Arise

1. **Document the problem** - Photos and written description
2. **Communicate clearly** - Discuss with builder in person
3. **Reference contract** - Point to specific requirements
4. **Set deadline** - Agree on resolution timeline
5. **Follow up** - Verify correction was made
6. **Escalate if needed** - Involve supervisor or take formal action

### Common Issues

**Measurement Errors:**
- Catch early in foundation phase
- Require correction before proceeding

**Material Substitution:**
- Verify materials match specifications
- Reject substandard alternatives

**Workmanship Quality:**
- Address immediately when spotted
- Document and require correction

**Timeline Slippage:**
- Regular communication about schedule
- Reference penalty clauses if needed
