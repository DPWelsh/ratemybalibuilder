Provide a villa floor plan and
multiple 3D renderings, so it's
easier for the buyer to
understand how the property
looks like when it’s completed.
You can also add photos of the
construction process,
information about your
experience, your portfolio,
information about the area,
travel times to the beach and
other popular spots, information
about the current Real Estate
market in Bali, and more.
Instagram for Sales. Start your
Instagram page right after the 3D
renderings are ready. Put photos of
the designs of the villa and update
your followers about the
construction progress in Stories. You
should also add it to your profile
Highlights with a name like “The
Build”. Apart from this, create a
Highlight “Villa for Sale” and put all
the information about the villa in it.
Don’t forget to put a link to your
website in your profile header. Ask
your friends and colleagues to
promote your page on their social
media, share links to your account
on different public sites and you will
be able to gain a few hundred
followers organically. The most
important is to keep the profile
updated by telling a story about
your project and sharing
information about its progress
regularly.
Adding hashtags to your post is a
great way to be discovered by new
people. Try to use hashtags that are
not too popular (up to 1 million
posts) because the competition for
these hashtags is too high and your
post will get lost among other posts
of big accounts or promoted posts.
However, don’t use too narrow
hashtags (less than 10,000 posts) as
they are too unpopular and won’t
benefit you anyhow.  

Connect your Instagram page with
Facebook and all the content that
you publish on Instagram will be
automatically shared on your
Facebook page as well. This will
help you to reach out to people on
two different platforms
simultaneously.

Facebook Groups. Join Facebook
groups where your potential
customers could be. Don’t publish
advertising content but try to make
a connection with the group
members first. It’s a bad tone to
flood the feed with your ads plus
most of the admins will delete your
posts or even ban you from the
group. Instead, we suggest you
share your experience, put a link to
your project, and ask if someone is
in the same industry as you. 
This kind of post will look like an
attempt to network and it usually
has great feedback from admins
and group members. Later, you can
start conversations with people who
positively responded to your post.
Do the same thing in a different
group and see how many prospects
you can get from such techniques. 
We suggest never publish copy-
paste posts in the same group. Be
creative, ask people a question and
then share your link in the
comments, see what others are
talking about and join
conversations. Treat it like real
networking but online.
