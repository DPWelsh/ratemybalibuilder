## Determining Your Customer Audience

Understanding your target customer audience (CA) is essential for making smart design and investment decisions. Your CA influences everything from villa size to amenities, location choice, and pricing strategy.

## Why Customer Audience Matters

Before building, you must answer: **Who will rent or buy this property?**

Your target audience determines:
- Villa size and number of bedrooms
- Design style and amenities
- Location selection
- Price point
- Marketing strategy

Building without a clear CA often results in a property that appeals to no one in particular.
