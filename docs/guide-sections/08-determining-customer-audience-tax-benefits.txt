EXPECTED INCOME
We calculate income to understand
how much money goes to our pocket
after all the charges are applied. So
take the number of your Low / High
revenue and minus the total amount of
costs from it. 
The calculation looks like this: $4651 (or
$6047) - $488 of monthly expenses. To
find out how much income your
investment brings you in a year, simply
multiply the monthly income by 12.

INVESTMENT
PAYOUT
Since we present these calculations to
our buyers, we want them to know how
long it will take for them to get their
invested money back. To calculate this,
take the Annual Income and divide it
by the price of the investment or the
cost of the land and building. It’s
important to consider the worst and
the best-case scenario, so calculate it
for Low and High payouts. The Payout
calculation looks like this: $260,000 /
$49,960/year (or $66,704/year) = 5.2
years to 3.9 years.
To calculate the percentage of annual
yield you will need to divide the same
numbers for Low and High scenarios
but in reverse like this: $49,960/year (or
$66,704/year) / $260,000 to give you
19% to 26% annual return. As you can
see, the rate of return on purchasing or
building a rental villa in Bali can be
extremely profitable. Please see our
calculations below and we can send
you a copy of our spreadsheet upon
request.

DESIGNING PROCESS
We know that you have a picture of a
dream project in mind that you want to
build. However, before just going for it,
ask yourself an important question - is
this design going to be liked by many?
In other words, will anyone else like it?
Is there a demand for this product in
the market? 
To answer this, you have to do your
homework.

GETTING INSPIRED
Go online and ask people what their
favorite villa (of your price segment and
CA) is in Bali. Find this villa on Airbnb
and see what is their occupancy rate,
price per night, reviews, design,
location. 
Try to find at least five villas like this
and try to understand why they are so
popular and in demand. What in
common do they have? Maybe there is
a niche in the market that has high
demand but short in supply. Try to
understand what will be the
competitive advantage that will
differentiate you from them if you build
something similar. Sometimes, it's
smarter to just follow the leaders of the
market rather than inventing a bicycle
over and over again. 
For example, our three-bedroom villas
are segmented as an affordable luxury,
CA is families and adult groups of
friends. We create such a design that
we think this CA will like. The design is
clean, modern, minimalistic, without
excessive interior details and bright
colors. We call it Tropical Modern. The
main differentiation from our
competitors is niches in the wall and
sunken lounges.

These features are being copied by
other investors but we don’t mind
because we understand that it’s a
smart way to do it. If you see that
something is working very well for your
competitors, don’t hesitate to apply it
to your project whenever it makes
sense. 
Also, what do you think is the number
one platform to promote your villa?
Yep, it's Instagram. Make your villa
Instagramable, add a feature wall or a
beautiful cabana near the pool. This
should be unique as it will be a
signature feature of your villa. In other
words, when people look at the photo,
they should recognize your villa right
away. 
Of course, it’s not easy to find your
signature design. To get more
inspiration, go to Pinterest and save all
the photos you like in one folder. When
choosing photos, try to be consistent.
For example, if you decide to build in
Mediterranian style, stick to it and
choose photos that are related to it.
Otherwise, you confuse yourself with
too many different options of styles and
designs.
