## Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)

Before committing to any villa project, you must understand your expected Return on Investment (ROI). This chapter walks you through calculating realistic returns for a Bali rental property.

## Why ROI Calculations Matter

Accurate ROI projections help you:
- Determine if an investment is worthwhile
- Compare different opportunities
- Set realistic expectations
- Plan your financial future
- Avoid costly mistakes

## The ROI Formula

The basic ROI calculation is:

```
Annual ROI (%) = (Annual Net Income / Total Investment) × 100
```

For investment payback period:

```
Payback Period = Total Investment / Annual Net Income
```

## Step 1: Calculate Your Total Investment

Your total investment includes:

### Land Costs
- Purchase price or lease payments
- Legal fees and notary costs
- Land survey costs
- Due diligence expenses

### Construction Costs
- Builder contract (per square meter × total area)
- Architectural design fees
- PBG permit costs
- Geological survey
- Utility connections (PLN electricity, water)

### Finishing Costs
- Interior design and decoration
- Furniture and fixtures
- Pool equipment
- Landscaping
- Kitchen appliances

### Additional Costs
- Contingency fund (10-15% recommended)
- Project management fees
- Insurance during construction

### Example Total Investment

| Category | Cost (USD) |
|----------|------------|
| Land (25-year lease) | $80,000 |
| Construction (150m² × $800/m²) | $120,000 |
| Interior and furniture | $30,000 |
| Permits and legal | $10,000 |
| Contingency (10%) | $20,000 |
| **Total Investment** | **$260,000** |

## Step 2: Calculate Monthly Costs

Operating a rental villa involves ongoing expenses:

### Fixed Monthly Costs
- Staff salaries (cleaning, gardening, security)
- Villa management fees
- Internet service
- Pool maintenance
- Garden maintenance
- Insurance (monthly portion)

### Variable Costs
- Electricity (PLN)
- Water
- Guest supplies
- Repairs and maintenance
- Marketing costs

### Shared Costs
If you have multiple properties nearby, you can share:
- Security personnel
- Gardening services
- Pool maintenance
- Cleaning staff

### Example Monthly Costs

| Expense | Cost (USD) |
|---------|------------|
| Staff (shared) | $150 |
| Pool maintenance | $50 |
| Internet | $40 |
| Electricity | $100 |
| Management fees | $100 |
| Maintenance reserve | $50 |
| **Total Monthly Costs** | **$490** |

## Step 3: Determine Your Daily Rate

Research the market to set competitive pricing:

### How to Research Rates
1. Search Airbnb for similar properties in your area
2. Compare villas with similar:
   - Bedroom count
   - Location
   - Amenities
   - Design quality
3. Note both high and low season rates
4. Check occupancy indicators (calendar availability)

### Rate Considerations
- Is your villa newer than competitors?
- Better location? Adjust rates accordingly
- Unique features that justify premium pricing?
- Consider both conservative and optimistic estimates

### Example Daily Rates

| Season | Daily Rate (USD) |
|--------|------------------|
| Low season | $170 |
| High season | $220 |
| Average | $195 |

## Step 4: Estimate Occupancy Rate

Be realistic about occupancy:

### Typical Occupancy Rates
- **Strong market (established property):** 75-85%
- **Average market:** 60-70%
- **New property (year 1):** 50-60%
- **Conservative estimate:** 50-60%

### Factors Affecting Occupancy
- Location and accessibility
- Competition in the area
- Marketing effectiveness
- Guest reviews and ratings
- Seasonal demand

**Recommendation:** Use conservative estimates (60-70%) for financial planning. Higher occupancy is a bonus, not a guarantee.

## Step 5: Calculate Revenue

Monthly revenue calculation:

```
Monthly Revenue = Days × Daily Rate × Occupancy Rate
30.4 days × $195 × 70% = $4,149
```

### Revenue Scenarios

| Scenario | Occupancy | Daily Rate | Monthly Revenue |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 60% | $170 | $3,101 |
| Moderate | 70% | $195 | $4,149 |
| Optimistic | 80% | $220 | $5,350 |

## Step 6: Calculate Net Income

Subtract costs from revenue:

```
Monthly Net Income = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Costs
$4,149 - $490 = $3,659
```

Annual net income:

```
Annual Net Income = Monthly Net Income × 12
$3,659 × 12 = $43,908
```

## Step 7: Calculate ROI

Using our example figures:

```
Annual ROI = ($43,908 / $260,000) × 100 = 16.9%
```

Payback period:

```
Payback = $260,000 / $43,908 = 5.9 years
```

### ROI Range Analysis

| Scenario | Annual Income | ROI | Payback |
|----------|---------------|-----|---------|
| Conservative | $31,332 | 12% | 8.3 years |
| Moderate | $43,908 | 16.9% | 5.9 years |
| Optimistic | $58,320 | 22.4% | 4.5 years |

## Additional ROI Considerations

### Marketing Fees
If using a marketing service, factor in:
- 10-15% of revenue for professional marketing
- Airbnb service fees (typically 3%)
- Payment processing fees

### Capital Appreciation
Your property may appreciate in value:
- Land values in popular areas have increased significantly
- Building improvements add value
- Consider resale potential in your calculations

### Lease Depreciation
For leasehold properties:
- Value decreases as lease term shortens
- Factor lease extension costs
- Plan for end-of-lease scenarios

## Creating Your Own ROI Spreadsheet

Track these key figures:

1. **Investment costs** (itemized)
2. **Monthly operating costs** (itemized)
3. **Daily rates** (low, average, high)
4. **Occupancy estimates** (conservative to optimistic)
5. **Revenue calculations** (multiple scenarios)
6. **Net income projections**
7. **ROI and payback calculations**

## Red Flags in ROI Claims

Be skeptical of:
- Promised returns over 25% annually
- Assumptions of 90%+ occupancy
- Ignored operating costs
- No consideration for vacancies or maintenance
- Unrealistic daily rates

## Key Takeaways

1. **Calculate conservatively**—better to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed
2. **Include all costs**—hidden expenses destroy projected returns
3. **Research the market**—base rates and occupancy on real data
4. **Plan for scenarios**—understand best and worst case outcomes
5. **Factor in your time**—managing a property has value
6. **Update projections**—recalculate as market conditions change

Thorough ROI analysis is the foundation of a successful investment. Take the time to run the numbers before committing your capital.
