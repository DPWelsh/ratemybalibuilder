CREATING THE DESIGN
Once you figure out the style and have
your mood board ready, it’s time to find
a designer. Unless you’re a professional
interior designer yourself, hiring a
designer is a must. When you talk to a
designer, your Pinterest photos will
come in handy. It’s always better to
show than explain what you mean. 
Keep in mind that some designs might
work very well in one region but make
no sense in another. Sometimes the
designer can offer to slightly modify the
design and adjust it to the harsh
climate in Bali. 
For example, we recommend always
adding overhanging to the roof to
create shade inside the building. With
larger overhanging, it won’t be
overwhelmingly bright and hot inside
the villa, which will make living much
more comfortable and decrease the
usage of the Air Conditioner which can
be expensive. We have been told by a
lot of our guests that they love other
villas with large windows but it gets
way too hot inside and is not
comfortable to live in. You have to find
a balance between what will look good
in photos and what will work in reality.

Larger overhangs will also help keep
the rain away from your foundation and
will help prevent water from damaging
and getting into the villa walls which
creates mold. Another advantage of
overhangs in Bali is that it helps to keep
bats’ and birds’ droppings away from
your walls and windows. This can cause
quite a mess and you will not want to
see any of these droppings on your
freshly painted white walls.

Rain: Bali is a tropical destination
and can get a lot of rain during the
rainy season. You will have to design
your project with an efficient
drainage system so that the heavy
rains don’t flood your property. We
recommend installing multiple
drainage pipes in your garden and
under your deck if you have one. We
also recommend using a rain gutter
system around your roof and to use
the best possible roofing materials
to reduce the chances of water
damage. We recommend having
your builder install a waterproof
membrane under your walls and
floors to help prevent groundwater
from entering your walls (see p. 37).
Parking Size: Make sure that even
at full capacity, your property can
provide a parking space for every
guest. Many villas in Canggu only
allow for scooter parking. However,
you should ensure there is enough
space for car parking as it’s essential
for many guests with families and
guests from Jakarta. 
We have created a list of design
considerations below that you should
keep in mind for your villa project or if
you are purchasing a villa in Bali:
35
Storage: Cleaning staff and
gardeners need to keep their
supplies somewhere at the villa but
many investors forget to arrange
this. Your guests might also want to
use it to keep their suitcases
somewhere between stays and you
will need to have an area to keep
additional bedding and towels for
the guests. In addition, if you are
going to be using the villa part-time,
we recommend putting your most
valuable items in locked storage
when you are not staying at the villa.
Laundry: There are a lot of laundry
services in Bali. However, if you want
to keep your guests from the stress
of getting their clothes ruined by an
external laundry service, we
recommend having a washing
machine in the villa. You can
dedicate a room to it or you can
place it in the storage to save space.

Enclosed or Open Concept Living
Room & Kitchen: This is a hot topic
for most villa owners in Bali. Open
concept means that the living room
and kitchen don’t have walls or
enclosed doors and you are open to
the elements. Most of the previously
built villas in Bali are open concept
as you don’t need to pay for
additional air conditioning and this
allows for nice ventilation in the
humid climate. The open concept
design gives you a better feeling of
the holiday as you’re closer to
nature. However, your guests will
have to deal with wildlife of the
island such as spiders, bats, snakes,
frogs, and many mosquitos at night.
The enclosed concept design is
what we prefer going forward in
Bali. We have found that open
concept designs are having a more
difficult time on the rental and
resale market. The open concept
design is becoming a thing of the
past as it’s not livable for the long
term. You can always twist the
design and get the vibe for your
place that you want. For example, to
provide a holiday feeling, we put
large window walls with sliding
glass doors. The guests have the
option of having a fully enclosed
living room and kitchen whenever
they want and they can close the
doors at night, when the mosquitos
are the worst, or during the hottest
parts of the day.  
36
Covered Outdoor Area: We
recommend designing in some sort
of covered outdoor area. In our
experience, we have found that any
outdoor area that is not covered will
get damaged by the harsh sun as
well as bird and bat droppings. It’s
also nice to have a covered outdoor
area where you can be outside but
escape from the harsh tropical Bali
sun. 
Air Conditioner. It's important to
keep a comfortable temperature in
the house so we choose to have air
conditioners in every room except
the bathrooms. Sometimes, however,
ACs can make your living
uncomfortable and negatively
impact your interior. To help you
avoid this, we've got some tips for
you. First of all, try to place AC over
the doorway so it won't be the first
thing you see when entering the
room. You can also partly hide the
AC inside the ceiling so it's less
noticeable in the room. When
installing AC in the bedroom, make
sure it's not right above the bed.
Otherwise, the cool air will blow right
on you all night and condensation
may drop on your bed.

Material for the Tropics: When
choosing construction material for
your villa, you want to make sure
that they will last. We have been
complimented on the large steel
doors and windows in our villas that
are made from galvanized steel.
However, we have noticed on other
projects, where builders have used
standard steel doors and windows,
and they have started rusting almost
immediately after being installed.
We recommend using slightly more
expensive materials that are
designed for the climate. It will save
you in the long run from high
maintenance costs as well as taking
your rental villa off the market to
make repairs. Materials that we use
for our villas:
Ironwood. It is the most water
and sun-resistant wood you can
find in Bali. We use it for a pool
deck.
Recycled teakwood. This
material is not cheap but it
keeps its qualities and looks like
new for a very long time. To
prolong the colour for even
longer, we cover the surface with
a water-based seal. You will also
have an option to use wax for
coating. However, keep in mind
that wax will have to be renewed
every 6 months and, also, it
makes wood a little bit darker.
We use teakwood for ceilings,
furniture, and doors.
Limestone. This is one of the
most favourite materials in Bali
for many. We used limestone to
decorate a wall of the outside
lounge and it looks fantastic. The
only issue with the limestone you
might have is mould. Our outside
lounge has a glass roof that
prevents rainwater to wet the
wall. Of course, even with the
roof, Bali humidity will do its job
and the mould might form on
the limestone, turning it from
light beige to brown colour.
Make sure to spay the wall with
anti-mould liquid once or twice a
year and your limestone will
keep its beautiful colour for a
long time.

Greenstone. We use greenstone
tiles for our swimming pools. It
gives the water a beautiful
turquoise colour. Sometimes,
greenstone tiles can turn brown
when in contact with pool water.
We had to replace a few tiles
because of this issue. To make
sure that replaced tiles won't
turn brown as well, put the tiles
in the pool water overnight and,
if they keep their blue colour, use
them as the replacement. We
assume this issue takes place
because of some chemicals that
are being added to the water by
the pool cleaner.
Galvanised steel. This is one of
the most expensive materials but
considering the Bali humidity
and harsh rainy seasons, we can't
compromise the quality here. All
our doors and windows are
made of galvanized steel. It
doesn't rust, change volume or
shape. Our sliding doors open
and close smoothly and never
gave us any trouble within years.
Terrazzo. Beautiful material that
will give a unique look to your
villa. We use terrazzo plant pots
and bathroom countertops in
our villas in Canggu. We are also
planning to build a terrazzo
swimming pool in one of our
villas in Bingin. If you would like
to use this material for your villa,
make sure to use a trusted
supplier because if the quality of
terrazzo is not good, it can crack
and chip easily. If this happens,
you will probably not be able to
fix it, only replace it. When
choosing terrazzo, take a look at
the amount and size of stones in
it. If there are only bigger stones,
the material will most probably
crack. When the bigger stones
are mixed with a lot of small
stones, the material is stronger
and less likely to crack.

Privacy:  With the cost of land
increasing every year in Bali, people
have been trying to maximize the
building area. You may currently
have land or a villa that has a great
view of rice paddies, but if you don’t
own the adjacent rice paddies, then
you should plan on losing this view
to a new villa project. We had a
neighbor that had a beautiful villa
with a rice paddy view until the
neighbor built an ugly 3 story guest-
house directly on their property line.
They lost their view and they were
stuck with an unsightly building
next to them that could view
directly into their property. A view
can be amazing but be prepared to
future proof your villa for buildings
that will pop up around yours. On
our projects, we have the villas all
facing a common access road and
we keep all villas one story high. By
doing this, we ensure that there are
no visible site lines from other villas
on the other side of the road. It
allows for more natural light to
enter the villas and gives the whole
project a more open feeling. Again,
less is more so don’t try to build on
every square meter of your land and
allow for additional open green
space.

Polished Cement. This material,
if done right, can save you quite
a bit of money and, also, it looks
amazing on the interior. We love
using cement for sunken lounges
in our villas. It is also popular to
use cement for showers and
floors. However, you should be
ready for it to get cracked and
change colour in some places.
For this reason, we would not
recommend using cement for
big surfaces. It's important for us
to keep sunken lounges
photogenic and to avoid the
problem of colour change, we
paint them in the same colour as
cement.

villa. This time we chose to use grey ceramic
tiles instead of cement tiles.

Soundproofing:  We recommend
soundproofing the ceilings of your
bedrooms if you are building a
classic peaked-roof-designed villa.
Putting soundproofing above the
gypsum ceiling will cut down on
sound coming from roosters, busy
roads, heavy rains, and other villas.
This soundproofing is also a great
isolator and will help you save on air
conditioning costs going forward.
We also recommend putting your
pool pump and pump used to
pressurize your showers and taps far
away from bedrooms and within an
underground room to reduce the
noise that comes from these pumps.
Waterproofing: It is crucial to
waterproof every wall in your villa,
especially if you build in a humid
Bali climate. Waterproofing is
something that you want to invest
money in and do it properly during
your villa build. We call it an
investment because, in the future,
you will be able to save a lot of
money and time on frequent mold
removals and maintenance of the
aesthetic look of the walls. Based on
our building experience and
monitoring of the other villas build,
we realized that what most
investors do in terms of
waterproofing, is not enough.
Because most of the moisture is
coming up from the ground, there is
a high chance that you will start
noticing mold from the bottom of
the wall.
Termites control measures: Before
waterproofing the floor and putting
a plastic liner, make sure your
builder evenly spread a special
granola that will protect your
building from termites. This simple
step is not in common practice
among builders in Bali but it will
help you to prevent termite
problems in the future.
We put waterproofing coating from the
middle of the wall all the way down to
the floor, in the corner, and 30 cm from
the wall on the floor surface. For extra
waterproofing, we install a special
membrane between the wall and the
floor. Make sure your builder sets the
membrane before they start building
the walls and properly coat the areas
we described above.
You can often see the mold starts forming on
the bottom of the wall in cheaper constructions
