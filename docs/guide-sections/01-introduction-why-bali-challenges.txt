WHY BALI
The price of the land and property on
the island is relatively inexpensive when
compared to other world-class
destinations and considering the
popularity of Bali among foreign and

growing number of digital nomads and
many others that are moving to Bali to
have a higher quality of life. If you like
tropical weather, then the climate is
definitely on point. 
Bali is an exotic location for many but it
also offers the western comforts that
make it a very livable place for
foreigners. Investing in Bali real estate
