With Kadecons we built our first villas in
Canggu that became popular. After two
years from the build, the villas are in
great condition and require minimal
maintenance.
Kadecons provides a year warranty after
the construction was completed. So if
you will see any cracks on the walls (it
often happens when the building is
setting down during the first year after
the build) or any other imperfections,
the company will fix them for free.
Tell Kadecons that you got their
contact information from The Young
Villas so you can get a free one hour
consultation with us. 
Make sure to use a trusted contractor
for your project. Your investments are in
their hands not only during the
construction process but for many years
after.

It is extremely important to have a notary
that you can trust. Yuli will provide a
detailed due diligence report on the land
or villa that you want to purchase. She
works in your best interest to ensure that
there are no loans on the property, that
the title is correctly owned by the person
selling, and they will complete a zoning
check to see the official zoning of the land
that you are purchasing. We highly
recommend Yuli as she does an extremely
thorough job but will efficiently complete
all the documentation.

Although banks are not a true supplier, they
are required when investing in Bali real
estate. We highly recommend using
Permata bank as their App makes it super
easy to send and receive money in Bali. You
do not need to be an Indonesian resident to
open an account. Tole, the bank manager,
will take you through the application
process and help you set up the App. If you
have your Kitas or work visa, you can also
apply for a credit card. Unfortunately, only
Indonesian citizens can get mortgages and
loans.

It is also important to protect your
investment by getting insurance right
after the construction is done or even
during the construction if it’s a larger
development. We recommend using a
European insurance company such as
Allianz to provide your property the best
protection. We recommend contacting
them to get a full list of damage
protection and review the contract
carefully before signing. Karlina is
extremely helpful and will prepare a
quote quickly for your review.
