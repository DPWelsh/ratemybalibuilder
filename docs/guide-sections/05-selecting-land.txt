Are there rice paddies next to the
plot? This might be seen as an
advantage because nobody will
build anything any time soon in this
area, so the view is guaranteed.
However, consider the end of the
harvest season, when the dry grass is
burnt. We don’t see ourselves
enjoying tanning on the poolside
covered in smoke. How about your
villa guests? Rice paddies are also a
favorite place for mosquitoes to
breed, so consider that as well. 
Is there a popular
nightclub/bar/restaurant next
door? If your target audience is not
clubbing youngsters that don't like
to sleep at night anyway, then try to
avoid such neighbors. Many of the
properties near the beach in
Canggu and Seminyak complain of
the high level of noise from outdoor
clubs and beach parties.
Is the land plot too remote? People
usually don’t like to travel too far in
Bali to get to the closest restaurant,
gym, or other everyday destinations.
If your target is families, check how
far are schools and daycare.

How hard is the ground? You will
need to get a geological survey to
determine the depth to which you
will have to set your foundations. If
the ground is too soft (most of the
rice paddies in Bali), you will
potentially need to set your
foundation deeper by driving steel
piles down to hard rock. It’s also
important to know how many floors
are going to be in your building. If
the building is higher than one
story, then you will need to plan for
deeper foundations to hold the
weight of the larger building at a
higher cost. 
How do I plan for water drainage
on this land? The water from your
land must go into a drainage system
next to the road of your property. If
the land plot slops towards the
access road, you can work with the
natural slope of the land to drain
water off your property. If your land
plot slopes away from the access
road, then you should raise the
ground so the water drains towards
the road. If you don’t do this, the
water from your land can flood your
neighbor’s property and this is not
allowed. Ensure that your builder
has a lot of drainage points to
ensure that water will drain away
from your property as quickly as
possible after it rains. This will
protect your foundations and
reduce the chance of damp and
mold entering your villa walls.

ROAD ACCESS
The road access to the property is a
factor that can break a deal. Many don’t
realize how important it is to figure out
what access to the property will be
before you buy the land. Road access is
not always given by default. You can
buy a beautiful piece of land at a great
price, but with no access road, nobody
can get to your property. Thus, it’s
crucial to take care of the access road
before you seal the deal with the
landowner. It will be easier to negotiate
the price for the access road if the
surrounding land plots are owned by
the same owner. You just buy
additional land or get signed
permission in the notarized contract
from the owner and the problem is
solved. 
18
If the owner is different, then you will
have to start negotiations with the new
person (sometimes, with the whole
family). This is when you might face
problems as they might not be
interested in selling you such a small
and narrow piece of land and dividing
their land plot into smaller pieces. This
might be the case, but it is worth trying.
If you manage to buy the land for the
road, you will have private access to
your property, which will increase the
value of your project and you can sell it
at a higher price. To have a private
access road is especially important if
you are building a bigger luxury
property. For example, villas that we
build in Bingin, Uluwatu have a private
access road and therefore yield a
higher price point.
Hot tip: Just like the road access, the
drainage access should be negotiated
in advance. Before signing any papers,
find out where your villa will be
draining the water. Does this drainage
belong to the land owner you're
dealing with or another person? Some
neighbours might block your access to
their drainage so its better to clarify
and negotiate it at the early stage.

LAND ZONING
Orange - Commercial buildings.
Yellow - Residential buildings.
Green - Agricultural Land but you
can build temporary structures.
When you search for land or villas, you
should already know what land zoning
is suitable for your type of project.
There are many different zones but you
should consider the three main types in
the South Kuta or Uluwatu Area: 
The zoning has been changed in the
Kuta Area (Kuta, Waterbom Area,
Discovery, Legian, and surrounding
area) and North Kuta Area (Seminyak,
Batubelig, Berawa, Canggu, Pererenan,
and surrounding area) on March 1st,
2021. The map on the government
website has not been updated yet
(http://itr.badungkab.go.id/peta).
Uluwatu and Bingin are located in the
South Kuta Area and the zoning was
updated 3 years ago, but there are
rumors that the land zoning will be
updated again to allow for more
commercial and residential
development.

South Kuta Area (Uluwatu) Color
Coded Land Zoning Map


--- PAGE 22 ---

Pink/Purple is zoned W1 and W2 for
tourism and larger commercial
developments including hotels
Yellow (3 different shades of yellow)
for residential depend on the level
of density
Red (4 different shades) for
shops/commercial and mixed with
residential development
Green is for wetlands or agricultural
use
We downloaded the new zoning map
in North Kuta and the resolution is very
poor for the moment (have not
included it because it’s so hard to read)
but the new zoning color coding is as
follows:
 
In summary, we have found that the
new zoning map is more complicated
than before but the updated zoning
has fewer wetlands or Green Zone land
after the recent update. Therefore,
there is more land area in Berawa,
Canggu, Pererenan that is currently
available to build now. We recommend
getting the most up-to-date and official
zoning maps before you buy property
to ensure that you can build what you
desire. 
20
Usually, the land agent can tell you
what the zoning of the land is but we
suggest you check the zoning by
yourself on this website
itr.badungkab.go.id. 
Make sure that the zoning of the land is
suitable for your project before you buy
the land. Before purchasing the land or
villa, your notary will check the official
zoning certificate, to again ensure that
you know the official zoning of the
land. Changing the zoning will be
extremely difficult and time-
consuming. Don’t get yourself into this
problem. 
We often see that foreigners build
permanent buildings in the green zone.
We don’t suggest doing it as you will
never get your official PBG (building
permit) approved to build the project.
Many people are paying off government
officials to get PBG approval but we do
not recommend doing this. Everything
that is built without official permission
is illegal and can be destroyed or taken
away.
Hot Tip:  We had a client that purchased a large plot of Freehold land. However,
they didn’t check the zoning and upon later inspection half of the land was zoned
as a river because it was low-lying land. Therefore, they would not be able to
develop half of the land due to the zoning regulations banning building on rivers.
Please check the official zoning before purchasing the land.
