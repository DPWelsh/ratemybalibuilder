## Selecting the Right Land

### Determining Land Size

What land size should you go for? Obviously, you're limited by your budget. However, even with a large budget, don't just splurge on the biggest plot available.

Think strategically: **every square meter must bring value to the property** and help you sell or rent it at a higher price.

Before deciding on land size, answer two questions:
1. What is my overall budget?
2. What concept do I want to build?

### Space Requirements Beyond the Villa

Your budget determines how simple or luxurious your property will be. Apart from the main villa, you'll need space for:

- Water pump rooms and water tanks (can be underground)
- Parking space (car or scooter)
- Utility room for cleaning staff and gardener
- PLN electrical boxes (often forgotten!)
- Enclosed garbage area
- Private road access for exclusivity
- Security room
- Laundry and storage room
- Playground (increasingly popular for families)

### Maximizing Land Value

The right land size also depends on location prices. If you find a great plot at a good price, consider getting a bigger plot to:
- Expand pool areas
- Surround villas with lush landscaping
- Add features that increase property value

These enhancements make your project more attractive to buyers and justify higher prices.

### Pro Tip: GPS Mapping

Install a **GPS Fields Area Measure App** on your phone. It helps you:
- Calculate the exact size of plots you're viewing
- Measure distances from any point on the map
- Save favorite plots for later
- Share plot details and coordinates with land agents instantly

### Finding Hidden Opportunities

When looking for land, get on your bike and explore your target area personally. You might find plots that:
- Your land agent didn't know about
- Aren't listed yet
- Offer better value than advertised properties

## Critical Questions to Ask

### 1. Does the Land Zoning Fit Your Project?

We cover zoning in detail later, but here's a warning: if an agent promises that changing the zoning "won't be a problem" or that you can build despite wrong zoning, **find a different agent**. That person is focused on making a sale, not finding you the right property.

### 2. Who Is Building Next Door?

The neighboring land might be vacant with nice views today, but you never know what will be built there. Consider:
- A planned 5-story apartment building would block your views
- Shared exit roads will be constantly busy during construction
- Construction noise could prevent premium rentals for months or years

### 3. Is There a Noisy Road Nearby?

This shouldn't be a deal-breaker, but factor it into your design:
- Create natural barriers with trees and greenery
- Avoid windows facing the road
- Install soundproofing behind walls and ceilings

Smart design can overcome noise issues.

### 4. Is There Local Wildlife?

In Ubud and Uluwatu areas, monkeys are natural residents. While they may seem cute:
- They can be aggressive with dogs and children
- They're known to bite people
- They enter villas to steal items

Consider monkey-proofing measures in your boundary walls if building in these areas.

### 5. Are There Rice Paddies Nearby?

Rice paddies seem like an advantage—guaranteed views since no one will build there soon. However:
- During harvest season, dry grass is burned, creating smoke
- Rice paddies are breeding grounds for mosquitoes

Consider these factors when evaluating the land.

### 6. Is There a Popular Nightclub/Bar Nearby?

Unless your target audience is young partygoers, avoid plots near loud venues. Many properties near Canggu and Seminyak beaches struggle with noise from outdoor clubs and beach parties.

### 7. Is the Land Too Remote?

People don't like traveling far for restaurants, gyms, or daily necessities. If targeting families, check proximity to schools and daycare.

### 8. How Hard Is the Ground?

Get a geological survey to determine foundation depth requirements:
- Soft ground (common in former rice paddies) may require steel piles driven to bedrock
- Multi-story buildings need deeper, more expensive foundations

### 9. How Will Water Drain?

Water from your land must flow into the road drainage system:
- If land slopes toward the road, work with the natural grade
- If land slopes away, raise the ground to redirect water toward the road
- Flooding a neighbor's property is not allowed

Ensure your builder includes multiple drainage points to protect foundations and prevent damp/mold.

## Road Access

Road access can make or break a deal. Many buyers don't realize how crucial this is until it's too late.

**You can buy a beautiful plot at a great price, but with no access road, it's worthless.**

### Negotiating Access

If surrounding plots share the same owner, negotiating is easier—buy additional land or get notarized written permission.

If the access belongs to a different owner (often a whole family), negotiations become more complex. They may not want to sell a narrow strip that divides their property.

### The Value of Private Access

If you secure private road access, your property value increases significantly. Private access is especially important for luxury developments targeting premium buyers.

### Pro Tip: Drainage Access

Like road access, drainage access must be negotiated in advance. Before signing anything, find out:
- Where will your villa drain water?
- Does this drainage belong to your land owner or someone else?

Some neighbors may block drainage access, so clarify and negotiate early.
