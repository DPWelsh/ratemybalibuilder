## Interior Decorating

Interior decorating is a critical step that many investors underestimate. The right interior can significantly increase your villa's rental rates and appeal. This chapter covers how to approach decorating your Bali property.

## DIY vs. Hiring a Professional

### When to Hire an Interior Designer

Consider professional help if:

- Interior design isn't your specialty
- You want a cohesive, professional look
- You're not based in Bali to source items personally
- You want access to trade discounts and suppliers
- You want to save time and reduce stress

### Benefits of Professional Designers

A good Bali-based interior designer will:

- Create a comprehensive mood board
- Know the best local suppliers
- Get trade discounts you can't access
- Source custom furniture efficiently
- Ensure a cohesive aesthetic
- Handle logistics and delivery
- Save you from costly mistakes

### Cost Considerations

Interior designer fees vary but typically include:
- Design consultation and mood board
- Sourcing and procurement
- Project management
- Often justified by supplier discounts and time savings

## Sourcing Items Yourself

If you prefer to handle decorating personally:

### The Supplier Approach

Bali has excellent suppliers for:
- Custom furniture
- Lighting
- Textiles and soft furnishings
- Ceramics and pottery

- Art and decorative items

Working directly with suppliers can save money, but requires:

- Logistics coordination for delivery
- Storage during construction

### Key Decorating Principles

Mixing too many styles creates a cluttered, confusing aesthetic.

**Maintain a Color Palette**

Select 3-4 primary colors and use them consistently:
- Neutrals as the base (whites, creams, grays)

- Choose quality over quantity
- Leave breathing room
- Let architectural features shine
- Focus on a few statement pieces
