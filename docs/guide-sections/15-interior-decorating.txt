Instagram Ads
Create an Instagram post with a
series of 3D renderings or photos of
your villa and put the most essential
information in the description. The
first line of your text should give the
reader an understanding of what
this post is about. For example
“Luxury 3 Bedroom Villa in Canggu
for Sale (Leasehold)”. This way, you
will attract the attention of those
who are interested in purchasing
the villa and won’t waste your
budget on random people clicking
on your link.
As a call to action, choose “visit
website” so Instagram will target
your Ad to those people who are
more luckily to press on your link. As
a next step, set up a daily budget for
your Ad and choose how many days
you want to run it. We suggest not
to spend all your budget within one
day but stretch it over several days.
This way your Ad will have a chance
to reach more people. 
All the methods that we mentioned
above can work differently for
everyone. See how things work for
you and then decide whether you
want to continue certain activities or
not.

Roadside Banners
It’s a good idea to advertise your
villa locally as most people prefer
making such an expensive purchase
after meeting you in person and
visiting a construction site. Place
your ads on a busy shortcut and
near your villa location. This is when
a simple villa name will come in
handy because people can
memorize your villa name more
easily. Thus, those interested can
easily put your villa name in Google
and find your website and social
media.

Complete every section of the
Airbnb template. Do not leave any
section empty and provide as much
detail as possible about your villa. 
List out your amenities including
Night Security, Netflix, AC in the
living area, coffee machine, toaster,
blender, washing machine, and your
MBPS of internet speed as many
guests will work from home or want
to stream internet videos. If you are
using Little Island Villa
Management, we recommend
highlighting 24-hour concierge
support.
Get a professional photographer to
take photos of your villa. This will
make a big difference in how the
villa is viewed online. Do not include
people in these photos as this can
come across as unprofessional.
Airbnb has become an incredible
platform to list rental villas in Bali.
However, there is a lot of competition
and, therefore, you are going to have to
work hard to make your property stand
out. If you haven’t used Airbnb before,
we recommend using the following
recommendations to ensure that your
listing ranks as high as possible. 
We recommend doing the following
things to help your Airbnb listing rank
higher in guest searches: 
VILLA RENTAL
AIRBNB 
When you upload the photos to the
Airbnb system, it is extremely
important to give a description of
every photo. This will make your
photos searchable within search
engines. You will also need to link
each of your photos to the
corresponding rooms within the
Airbnb system. This improves your
ranking and enables guests to
search photos based on the room so
they get a better idea of the overall
space. 
To increase your ranking, have links
on your Instagram, Pinterest, and
Website directly to your Airbnb
listing. The general rule is the more
internet links that you have to your
Airbnb account the higher the
search ranking will be and the more
bookings you will get. 
If you get bookings from other
sources like Instagram, make sure
you update the booking calendar to
ensure that you don’t get a double
booking for those dates.
Respond to potential guest’s
requests and questions on Airbnb as
soon as possible and give them
accurate information so they are not
disappointed if you over-promise
something that isn’t available.
Once you get a booking, you can
pass the contact information from
the guest to the villa management
company. The villa management
company will organize airport pick-
up and any special requests that the
guest may have during their stay.
