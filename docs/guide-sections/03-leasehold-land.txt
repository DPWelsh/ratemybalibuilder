LEASING OR PURCHASING
LAND & PROPERTY 
IN INDONESIA
LEASEHOLD
A leasehold contract is the most
common way for foreigners to acquire
land in Indonesia. With a leasehold
contract, it doesn't require a foreigner
to have a KITAS (work permit) or PT
PMA (a company) to lease land. It is also
a great option for you if you have a
smaller budget as the prices for
leasehold land are way more accessible
than for freehold land. 
Leasehold contracts are discussed in
terms of Million IDR per year of lease
per Are. 
The unit of measurement 1 Are is equal
to 100 m2. 
Land leases can be sold from as little as
3.000.000 IDR/year/Are (USD 207) in
less popular areas to above 30.000.000
IDR/year/Are (USD 2070). 
Therefore, a land plot that is 6 Are (600
m2) leased for 30 years can cost
between 3.000.000 IDR/year/Are x 30
years x 6 Are = 540.000.000 IDR
($37,300 USD) to 30.000.000
IDR/year/Are x 30 years x 6 Are =
5.400.000 IDR ($373,000 USD) based on
the lands location and the current
market price. 
Hot Tip:  It may be possible to not pay
the entire term of the lease upfront.
You may be able to put down a deposit
on the land and hold it for the building
period. Then, when you are ready to sell
the property you can pay for the
remainder of the lease. 
We recommend that you make a
contract with the notary to ensure that
the deposit contract is valid and that
the lease terms are officially notarized.

You can lease the land for as short as
one year and extend it to up to 70
years. Normally, investors lease land for
about 25-30 years with the opportunity
to extend. We recommend you try
negotiating the extension at the fixed
rate right away so there is no
uncertainty in the future about what
the price for the extension will be. 
This might be tough to arrange as it’s
not very profitable for the landowner as
historically the prices of land have been
rising significantly over time. 
Most of the agreements allow lease
extension at the market price at the
time when the extension proceeds.
Normally, you can do the extension at
any time during the lease period but
this will need to be negotiated with the
freehold landowner. 
The earlier you do it the cheaper you
will pay for the extension as the market
price of the land goes up every year. 
However, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
try to negotiate a better price when you
decide to extend. Based on our
personal experience, the best time for
the negotiation is before religious
holidays. This is when the Balinese
owners need money for their
ceremonies and are open to
negotiations.

LEASE
EXTENSIONS
When you decide to extend the Lease,
every land owner (sometimes there can
be more than 10 family members who
own the land) will have to sign the
lease extension contract. If at least one
land owner doesn't sign, the extension
can't be proceed. Even if your lease
contract says that you have a right to
extend.
Hot tip: Before signing a lease contract,
negotiate the land extension terms and
ask your notary to prepare the deposit
contract for the lease extension. On the
day of signing the lease contract, you
and the landlord/s will sign the deposit
contract as well. Pay the extension
deposit right away and the rest amount
later. The date for the final payment
should be mentioned in the deposit
contract. The deposit payment can be
as little as 1 million IDR. 
At the time of the lease extension, you
will just transfer the remaining amount
to the landlord and finalize the
extension.
This is the only way to 100% guarantee
the extension at the fixed price.

If you build property for sale, you can
easily transfer the master lease
agreement to the buyer if they will be
leasing the land for the rest of the time
and the entire land area of the master
lease. The notary will notify the
landowner that the lease was
transferred so he will continue leasing
relationships with a new buyer. 
For example, you lease a small land plot
for 25 years and build one villa there. In
one year, you finish the construction
and sell this villa.
In this case, you can just transfer your
master lease agreement to the buyer
and end relationships with the
landowner. The villa buyer will be
leasing the land for the remaining 24
years if they decide not to extend. 
07
SELLING
LEASEHOLD
If you are selling a property that is
placed on a fraction of your larger
master lease land plot, you can
sublease a portion of the land to the
new buyer.
For example, if you lease a big land plot
and build multiple villas on it. Once you
sell one of these villas, you can sublease
that piece of the land plot to the new
villa buyer. This way, the villa buyer
leases that particular fraction of the
whole land plot that belongs to the
purchased villa. The master lease will
be held by the original leaseholder
unless they sell all of the lots within the
subdivided property to one owner. 
Later, the leased land can be subleased
an infinite amount of times by current
owners without the involvement of the
master lease owner.

FREEHOLD
Freehold land is “yours” forever. A little
correction, it’s not yours, however, your
company’s asset if you are a foreign
buyer. 
A while ago we ran a poll on Instagram,
asking our followers if they prefer
buying a freehold or leasehold land,
considering that freehold will require
over double the amount of investment.
Surprisingly, 68% of respondents chose
freehold. 
This way of land acquisition might be
more desirable for the majority as you
get to keep the land forever. In reality,
freehold works best for more serious
investors with a larger buying power
and Indonesian citizens. Thus, if you
just want to build your personal home
in Bali and your budget is tight, a
leasehold will work best for you.

BUYING FREEHOLD 
There are two ways of acquiring
freehold land in Indonesia as a
foreigner: through an Indonesian
nominee and through a locally
registered PT PMA company. We
recommend that you consult an
experienced and recommended notary
before buying any property.

NOMINEE
OWNERSHIP
This way to “purchase” property by
foreigners in Indonesia has been used
for a long time. However, it is extremely
risky as the Indonesian nominee can try
to withdraw the agreement and there
are no guarantees for you that this will
not be approved by an untrustworthy
notary. You also have to trust your
nominee a lot to use this method. We
don’t believe that this risk is justified so
we don’t recommend it. 
10
A loan agreement is established
between a foreigner and a local
Indonesian nominee for the price of
the land which states that the
money is to buy the land. 
Full and irrevocable power of
attorney is signed by the nominee
which waives the nominee’s rights
over the land. 
The power of attorney allows the
foreigner to use, sell, transfer or
lease the land without the need for
permission from the nominee. 
The power of attorney must also be
fully transferable so the foreigner
may pass the ownership on to
someone else and may change the
nominee if he/she wishes. 
An agreement is made which gives
the foreigner permanent rights to
occupy and use the land. This also
must be transferable. 
The original land certificate is held
by the foreigner. 
However, we will tell you what nominee
option is, just for your education:
The whole concept of “nominee” land
acquisition is a way to get around
Indonesian law. Even if you buy the
land and the nominee is a “good guy”,
you will have a lot of problems getting
PBG, selling, or renting out the property
legally as you may ultimately need their
approval to complete any of these
processes.
