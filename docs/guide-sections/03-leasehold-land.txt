## Leasing or Purchasing Land & Property in Indonesia

### Leasehold

A leasehold contract is the most common way for foreigners to acquire land in Indonesia. With a leasehold contract, it doesn't require a foreigner to have a KITAS (work permit) or PT PMA (a company) to lease land. It is also a great option for you if you have a smaller budget as the prices for leasehold land are way more accessible than for freehold land.

Leasehold contracts are discussed in terms of Million IDR per year of lease per Are. The unit of measurement 1 Are is equal to 100 m².

Land leases can be sold from as little as 3,000,000 IDR/year/Are (USD 207) in less popular areas to above 30,000,000 IDR/year/Are (USD 2,070) in prime locations.

### Example Calculation

A land plot that is 6 Are (600 m²) leased for 30 years can cost:
- **Low end:** 3,000,000 IDR/year/Are × 30 years × 6 Are = 540,000,000 IDR (~$37,300 USD)
- **High end:** 30,000,000 IDR/year/Are × 30 years × 6 Are = 5,400,000,000 IDR (~$373,000 USD)

The actual price depends on the land's location and current market conditions.

### Hot Tip: Deposit Strategy

It may be possible to not pay the entire term of the lease upfront. You may be able to put down a deposit on the land and hold it for the building period. Then, when you are ready to sell the property you can pay for the remainder of the lease.

We recommend that you make a contract with the notary to ensure that the deposit contract is valid and that the lease terms are officially notarized.

## Lease Extensions

You can lease the land for as short as one year and extend it up to 70 years. Normally, investors lease land for about 25-30 years with the opportunity to extend.

We recommend you try negotiating the extension at a fixed rate right away so there is no uncertainty in the future about what the price for the extension will be. This might be tough to arrange as it's not very profitable for the landowner—historically, the prices of land have been rising significantly over time.

Most agreements allow lease extension at the market price at the time when the extension proceeds. Normally, you can do the extension at any time during the lease period but this will need to be negotiated with the freehold landowner.

**The earlier you do it, the cheaper you will pay for the extension** as the market price of the land goes up every year.

### Best Time to Negotiate

Based on our personal experience, the best time for negotiation is before religious holidays. This is when Balinese owners need money for their ceremonies and are more open to negotiations.

### Important: Multiple Landowners

When you decide to extend the lease, every land owner (sometimes there can be more than 10 family members who own the land) will have to sign the lease extension contract. If at least one land owner doesn't sign, the extension can't proceed—even if your lease contract says that you have a right to extend.

### Hot Tip: Guarantee Your Extension

Before signing a lease contract, negotiate the land extension terms and ask your notary to prepare the deposit contract for the lease extension. On the day of signing the lease contract, you and the landlord(s) will sign the deposit contract as well.

Pay the extension deposit right away and the rest amount later. The date for the final payment should be mentioned in the deposit contract. The deposit payment can be as little as 1 million IDR.

At the time of the lease extension, you will just transfer the remaining amount to the landlord and finalize the extension. **This is the only way to 100% guarantee the extension at a fixed price.**

## Selling Leasehold Property

If you build property for sale, you can easily transfer the master lease agreement to the buyer if they will be leasing the land for the rest of the time and the entire land area of the master lease. The notary will notify the landowner that the lease was transferred so they will continue leasing relationships with the new buyer.

### Example: Single Villa Sale

You lease a small land plot for 25 years and build one villa there. In one year, you finish the construction and sell this villa. In this case, you can just transfer your master lease agreement to the buyer and end relationships with the landowner. The villa buyer will be leasing the land for the remaining 24 years if they decide not to extend.

### Subleasing for Multiple Villas

If you are selling a property that is placed on a fraction of your larger master lease land plot, you can sublease a portion of the land to the new buyer.

For example, if you lease a big land plot and build multiple villas on it, once you sell one of these villas, you can sublease that piece of the land plot to the new villa buyer. This way, the villa buyer leases that particular fraction of the whole land plot that belongs to the purchased villa.

The master lease will be held by the original leaseholder unless they sell all of the lots within the subdivided property to one owner. Later, the leased land can be subleased an infinite amount of times by current owners without the involvement of the master lease owner.
