## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Seed Database (Week 1-2)

   - Offer free "Verified Builder" status for first 30 days
   - Get their info: name, phone, Instagram, company

3. **Seed Reviews**
   - Ask 20 friends/network who've built in Bali
   - Offer $20 credit for first 100 reviews
   - Quality over quantity - need detailed reviews

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 3-4)

**Facebook Groups** (Post 2-3x per week)
- Canggu Digital Nomads
- Bali Expats

## Viral Growth Tactics

### 2. Free Value First

### 3. Referral Program

- Friend gets $10 credit too
- Track with referral codes

### 4. FOMO Builders

- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Budget Breakdown

### Month 1 (Bootstrap)
- Domain + hosting: $50
- Facebook group promo: $0 (organic)

- **Total: $250**

### Month 2-3 (Scaling)

- $2-5k revenue

### Month 3
- 2,000+ searches
- 500+ reviews
- 50+ paying builders
- $10-15k revenue

### Month 6
- 5,000+ searches/month
- 2,000+ reviews
- 100+ paying builders
- $25-40k revenue

## Red Flags (If Not Hit by Month 3)

- Less than 1,000 searches/month → traffic problem
- Less than 100 reviews → content/incentive problem
- Less than 20 paying builders → value prop problem
- High bounce rate (>70%) → UX problem

## Competitive Moats

1. **First-mover advantage** - No one else doing this
2. **Network effects** - More reviews = more value
3. **Brand trust** - Become the #1 name in Bali builders
4. **Data moat** - Database of 1,000+ builders is hard to replicate
