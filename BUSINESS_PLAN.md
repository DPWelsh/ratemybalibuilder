# RateMyBaliBuilder - Business Plan

## What We Actually Are

A **trust platform for Bali property investors** - combining builder verification, investment education, and a curated supplier network.

**Not** a lead-gen marketplace. **Not** a Yelp clone.

---

## Current State (Starting Point)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Builders in database | 84 |
| Reviews submitted | 36 |
| Guide chapters | 19 (complete) |
| Supplier contacts | 100+ |
| Revenue products live | 2 ($79 guide, $199/yr membership) |
| Payment processing | Stripe (working) |

---

## Revenue Model

### Primary: Memberships (B2C)

| Plan | Price | What They Get | Target Buyer |
|------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Guide** | $79 one-time | 19-chapter guide + PDF + ROI calculator | DIY researchers |
| **Investor** | $199/year | Guide + 100+ supplier contacts + priority verification | Active investors |

### Future: Builder Subscriptions (B2B) - Phase 2

|------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Verified** | $300/month | Badge, respond to reviews, see who searched | 200+ builders |
| **Premium** | $500/month | Featured placement, analytics, sponsored results | 500+ builders |

### Retired: Credit System
Pay-per-search model built but not activated. Memberships are simpler and higher LTV.

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (90 days) |
|--------|------------------|

| Paid members | 20 |

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't chase FB group virality** - Spammy, gets you banned, low-quality traffic
2. **Don't build more features** - Product is complete enough. Focus on distribution.
3. **Don't offer discounts** - $79 is already cheap for the value. Hold the price.
4. **Don't hire yet** - Automate what you can, do the rest yourself until $5K MRR.
5. **Don't launch builder subscriptions early** - Need critical mass first or it looks desperate.

---

## Competitive Advantage

| What We Have | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| Local verification team | Not just crowdsourced - we call builders |
| Investment guide | Content moat - takes months to replicate |
| Supplier directory | Direct WhatsApp links = immediate value |
| Builder database | 84 builders = searches return results |
| First mover | No direct competitor in Bali builder reviews |

---

## 90-Day Priorities (Ordered)

1. **Fix data quality** - Clean null company names, dedupe builders
2. **Add email capture** - On every free guide chapter
3. **Write 3 SEO articles** - Targeting "bali builder" keywords
4. **Get 10 detailed reviews** - Direct outreach to expats who've built
5. **Run $500 Google Ads test** - Measure CAC
6. **Email nurture sequence** - Convert free signups to paid
7. **First 10 paying members** - Validate the model

---

## Success Criteria

**In 90 days, we've succeeded if:**
- 10+ paying members ($790-1,990 revenue)
- 100+ reviews in database
- Organic traffic growing week-over-week
- CAC < $30 for guide, < $80 for Investor

**We pivot if:**
- Zero paid conversions after 60 days
- CAC > $100 consistently
- No organic traffic growth despite SEO efforts

---

## Team Roles

| Role | Focus Areas | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Partner** | Content creation, Instagram/social traffic, database building | Weekly IG content, builder submissions, review outreach |
| **Tech** | Product, SEO, paid acquisition, analytics | Platform fixes, Google Ads, conversion optimization |

### Partner Priorities
1. Post 3-5x weekly on Instagram (builder tips, horror stories, project showcases)
2. Engage in FB expat groups (value-first, not promotional)
3. Direct outreach to expats who've built - get their stories
4. Submit new builders to the database from local contacts
5. Build relationships with real estate agents for referrals

### Tech Priorities
1. Data cleanup and product fixes
2. SEO optimization and content publishing
3. Paid acquisition testing
4. Analytics and conversion tracking

## Notes on This Plan

This plan replaces the earlier phased strategy document. Key improvements:

- **Reflects what's actually built** - The previous plan described a lead-gen marketplace; we built a content + verification platform. This plan aligns strategy with product.

- **Focuses on the real value prop** - The Investment Guide and Supplier Directory are our differentiators. Builder ratings support these, not the other way around.

- **Simpler revenue model** - Memberships ($79/$199) instead of complex hybrid (pay-per-lead + search fees + ads). Higher LTV, easier to explain.

- **Actionable next steps** - Instead of broad tactics like "multi-channel marketing blitz," specific actions with clear success criteria.

- **Honest about where we are** - We're not in "pre-launch." We have 84 builders, 36 reviews, and live payment processing. The plan starts from reality.

The original plan had good instincts (photo-required reviews, follow-up reviews, phone lookup) - some of these are built, others are on the roadmap. This version builds on that foundation with sharper focus.
